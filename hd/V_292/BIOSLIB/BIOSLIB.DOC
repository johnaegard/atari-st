This set of files is a bios linkage for metacomco languages.
It allows calling BIOS routines by name and will automatically take care
of longword/word/byte conversions.  Make sure you use the TYPE and
RTNS include files to declare the routines as external.
I am currently working on similar deals fro XBIOS and GEMDOS,
but I just wanted to see if there was any interest in this sort of thinng.
Anyone who has use metacomco pascal knows that there is NO support for
GEMDOS,XBIOS, or BIOS in this language, and LATTICE C does not have
named calling of routines. This solves that problem for BIOS.
NOTE THE CHANGE IN SYNTAX FOR GETBPB!!!!!!!It will now fill a block
with the info that is only pointed to by the standard BIOS routine.
I haven't had much luck with getmpb or rwabs...if anyone has any
questions or comments about this linkage, or if anyone wants to see
the XBIOS / GEMDOS linkages, leave EMAIL to encourage me.
Also, if anyone needs info about the calls themselves(info is scant in
the .ASM file) leave EMAIL and I will try to help.  I learned a hell of a
lot about library file format and about metacomco pascal and assembler in
the process of preparing this linkage, so please ask if their manuals leave a 
bit too much to the imagination. I amy be able to help. XBIOS AND GEMDOS
coming soon!!!
(Also I could be tempted into providing more documentation for the library!)
