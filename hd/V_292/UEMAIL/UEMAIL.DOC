UEMAIL

This is an Emacs-like editor.  Print off the UEMAIL.HLP file for reference.

While in the editor, hitting the HELP key puts you in the KERMIT program.
The UNDO key returns you to the editor.

Hitting <Control-C> in the editor puts you in the command line interpreter.
You can run any programs (PRG) in the current folder or in the bin folder by 
typing their names (don't type .PRG at the end).  Typing EXIT qets you out
of the command line interpreter and back into the editor.
