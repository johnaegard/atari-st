      SMAKER.TOS is a simple utility which will turn binary image files into
  type O files.  When these type S files are assembled, they recreate the
  binary image.  The files can be merged into standard assembly language.
  
      SMAKER.TOS will allow you to insert image and icon files, screen
  dumps, and ASCII text files directly into your code.  Since SMAKER.TOS
  does NOT relocate code, it cannot be used to insert assembled code,
  compiled C programs or anything else that requires relocation.  However,
  However, SMAKER.TOS is extremely useful for inserting screen images and
  icons directly into the source of an assembly-language program, thus
  eliminating the need for the program to load extra files!
  
      You can use SMAKER.TOS with parameters, from a batch file, or you
  can click on it directly from GEM.  If you click on SMAKER.TOS directly
  without any parameters, the program will ask you for a list of commands
  separated by spaces.  Each command converts a separate file from binary
  image format into source format.  The original file is untouched, but a
  new file appears with the same name and a suffix of .S. 
  
      The source code generated by SMAKER.TOS consists of "DC.L" commands
  each of which is followed by four hex longwords, containing the data
  originally in the image file.  If necessary, a final line of "DC.B"
  commands will be added to contain trailing data.  The first "DC.L"
  command will be indicated by a single global label.  You can specify
  this label in the command line.  If you do not, the file name will be
  used as the label.
  
     For example, suppose you wish to add an icon to your program.  You
  make the icon and store it in a file called MYHAND.ICN.  Then you write
  your program, and whenever you want to refer to your icon, you use the
  label MYHAND.  Let's say the assembly-language source for your program is
  called MYPROG.S.
  
      First you execute SMAKER.TOS.  When asked, you type "MYHAND.ICN" and
  press RETURN.  SMAKER.TOS produces a file called "MYHAND.S."
  
      Now edit your program MYPROG.S, and merge the file MYHAND.S into
  it.  This inserts the data from MYHAND.ICN into MYPROG.S under the label
  MYHAND.  When you assemble MYPROG.S, MYHAND.ICN will be recreated in
  the middle of the program under the label MYHAND.
  
     Now suppose you want to refer to the data in MYHAND.ICN by a different
  name.  Suppose that when you wrote the program, you called the icon data
  THEHAND.  All is not lost!  Execute SMAKER.TOS.  When asked, you type
  "MYHAND.ICN(THEHAND)".  The new label name is in parentheses, with NO
  SPACE between it and the file name.  SMAKER.TOS will still produce a file
  called MYHAND.S, but the label will be THEHAND.  (Labels cannot be more
  than seven characters long: the label will be truncated to seven
  characters.)
