                     XBIOS MUSIC CONSTRUCTION KIT


          Make music like Mozart (or Motorhead) with maestro
               David O'Connell's powerful song editor


With this program you can easily include superb music in your programs, and it
works in BASIC, too. Using only about six commands you can load into your game
or demo music that was written with this program and it will play in the
background while your program runs uninterrupted. By including a few more
commands you can detect the end of the music and either restart it or load in
more music

    Don't worry if you don't can't compose to save your life and understand all
those tadpoles and telegraph wires as you can simply buy some sheet music and
copy it into the program. (However, most music is copyright so don't pass your
- copied - music around.)

                           MAIN PAGE FUNCTIONS

Top left is the bar indicator which shows the number of the bar displayed
onscreen. Under this are the arrows for moving the display of your song up one
bar, up two bars, back one bar and back two bars.

    Below this is the mark indicator which shows the part of the song being
edited. Clicking on this will also take you to the FIND MARK menu. Double
clicking lets you set a new mark at the current bar.

    To the right and at the top of the page is "TRACK 3 FEATURE" for switching
in the special effects of track three (more about this later). Below this is
"TRACK 2 FEATURE" which enables you to split track to at any point and assign
different voices to the upper and lower parts. To the right are the note values
and to the right of these is TIE to tie two notes together. Just click on TIE
then on the note you want to tie and it will be tied to the note in front.

    Next is SLUR. If two notes are slurred together the second note starts its
envelope from where the first note finished. Also there is a slight slide to
the second note. Because of the limitations in the ST's XBIOS routine the tempo
change is quite limited. When you click on PLAY a menu will appear giving you
options on where to play from. STOP, stops playback of song.

    To input notes on to screen just click mouse on the stave. Some rests are
added automatically, but you can also input a note of the same value then
finish the bar and go back and delete the note where you want the rest. To
delete a note double click on the track and a rubber band will appear. Hold
down the mouse button and drag the box to enclose all notes you want to delete
then let go of the mouse button.

    When you move the bar display the bars shown are included in the length of
the song even if you don't input any notes. This is why you can reduce the song
so that when you compile it for an XBIOS file these unwanted bars aren't
included.


Resolution differences
HI REZ: All three channels (tracks) of the ST are shown and to MUTE a track
click on the track number. On the voice edit page the "TEST SEQUENCE" is
displayed.

IN MED REZ: Only one channel (track) is displayed and to display other tracks
click on the track number to right of "EDIT TRACK". To mute a track click on
track number to right of mute track. On the voice edit page to edit the test
sequence click on "EDIT TEST EQUENCE"

                            VOICE EDITING PAGE

VOICE No.?: These are the voices you can create. To the right of each one is a
small box and clicking here will enable you to edit it. Double clicking on the
name enables you to rename it.

ENVELOPE: Displays the envelope of the voice being edited.

SLIDERS: UP/DOWN is the volume of the envelope.
         LEFT/RIGHT is the envelope speed.

NOISE GEN.: Turns the noise effect on/off for each voice and sets the
frequency. (The ST has only one noise frequency control therefore you will get
peculiar results by having noise on more than one track.) The two boxes under
the NOISE GEN. box display the voice name and number of the voice being
edited.

VIBRATO/TREMOLO: Click here toggle from one effect to the other.

VIBRATO:  Makes voices sound more realistic, but uses a lot of memory when
compiled for playing in your program.

TREMELO: Like vibrato, but changes the volume, not pitch.

If a voice file with the name DEF.VOC is on the disk when the program loads it
will be automatically loaded into the program.

                             EDIT MODE FUNCTIONS

VOICE: Edits the voices

TRACK: Clicking on track puts you into another edit mode hear the voices are
assigned to a note(like a drum machine) this means you can make up complex drum
patterns without making voice changes every note.To the left are the Different
Notes by clicking on a note number you can edit it The note value can now be
edited in the box witch is now under the Noise Gen.Box when this note is played
during your song it will have the note value you have set
hear for it THIS WILL ONLY WORK ON TRACK THREE AND ONLY WHEN THIS FEATURE IS
ON

.VOC   All voice info and the two sort sequences on voice edit page

.XBS   This is the file to use in you programs

                             MUSIC FROM BASIC

There are two program examples in GFA BASIC. One of these is a demo which came
free with GFA BASIC and has been changed to include sound files. The commands
in GFA BASIC to load the XBIOS music are:

OPEN "I",#1,F$                    !F$=name of file
A%=LOF(#1)                        !find length of music
DIM MUSIC_ADDR%(A%/4)             !and reserve memory
BLOAD F$,VARPTR(MUSIC_ADDR%(0))   !load
CLOSE #1

    To play music from GFA BASIC:

VOID XBIOS(32,l:VARPTR(MUSIC_ADDR%(0))


    To detect the end of the music:

A%=xBIOS(28,0,7)
IF A%=255 ... then the music has ended

    When music is playing using the Xbios routine it will be stopped by the
keyboard's key click, but this can be disabled with:

SPOKE &H484,PEEK(&H484) AND NOT 1

    And turned back on again with:

SPOKE &H484,PEEK(&H484) OR 1


    To halt the music while its playing:

NO_PLAY$=CHR$(8)+CHR$(0)+CHR$(9)+CHR$(0)+CHR$(10)+CHR$(7)+CHR$(255)+
         CHR$(-1)+CHR$(0)
VOID XBIOS(32,l:VARPTR(NO_PLAY$))


HARDWARE: ALL STs, MONO AND MEDIUM RES COLOUR
