Selectric¿ Changes	          Translation by Peter West and Joe Connor
==========================================================================

Version 1.01
------------
- Selectric¿ no longer bombs out if one tries to move the cursor in  
  an empty directory.
- If 'Let 'em Fly!' was not installed then the flying corner on the 
  main page always blinked quickly when it was called, which 
  naturally wasn't very nice.
- The percentage display for 'Disk info' should now be more accurate.
- If fewer than 8 files were visible in the window then an attempt to 
  jump to the start or end (e.g. by double-clicking on the arrows) 
  was sure to provoke a crash.
- If drives from 'P:' upwards were registered then one could suddenly 
  select drives up to 'Z', which of course was incorrect.
- The preset extensions can now only be reached via [CTRL]+[Numeric-
  pad 0-9]. With the old combination [CTRL]+[1-0] one can now move a  
  given number of directory levels upwards (this was previously done 
  by [CTRL]+[F1-F10]).
- Paths input as e.g. "C:*.TXT" are now altered to "C:\*.TXT".
- When calling the TOS file selector when unable to use Selectric¿ 
  due to memory shortage, though Selectric¿ was initialised it was
  not however 'de-initialised', which wasn't very nice.
- 'Save & restore paths' should now function properly. Through a 
  GEMDOS error one could get some *VERY* peculiar results...
- 'Save & restore paths' is now normally switched on.
- Selectric¿ now re-initialises its resources on a resolution change 
  from TT-Mid to ST-Mid/Low. With this there should be no display 
  problems any more.

Version 1.02
------------
- After repeated requests from several users one can now 
  alternatively save the configuration in an INF-file. An existing 
  INF-file naturally has a higher priority when starting up 
  Selectric¿ than the settings saved in Selectric¿ itself.
- During the Search function the environment-variable 'DRIVEMAP' is 
  now supported, which means that when searching all drives only those
  that were declared to this variable will be included.
  Example: DRIVEMAP=CDEFG.
  It is important that this is included in the AES-environment, as it 
  otherwise is not visible in a Desk Accessory under Gemini, which 
  also uses this variable for the same purposes.
- The Auto-locator now also lends a hand immediately after path- and 
  drive-changes. We were just too careful earlier, since we thought 
  that too much could appear to be annoying.
- During a re-sort any selections are now retained.
- 'Save TOS paths' now works in a different way: Previously the path 
  selections of all drives were saved at the start; that way 
  Selectric¿ was outwardly neutral. Unfortunately this method gave 
  rise to problems with interchangeable drives without an inserted 
  medium. Now the path is saved only at each drive change.
- There are now two new selection possibilities: a) If when selecting 
  the Fuller (or ^A) one presses the [SHIFT]-key then the selection 
  will be toggled (i.e. black becomes white and vice versa). b) Via 
  [CONTROL]+[S] (or [CONTROL]+Fuller) one can select using a mask of 
  one's choice. For this too the selection will be toggled, and only 
  files (i.e. no folders) will be taken into consideration.
- The BeamUps have been extended by a small feature. One can now also 
  reach an entry directly by pressing a numeric or letter key. For 
  this the first letter/number in the entry will always be taken 
  into consideration. Leading 'special' characters (non-alphanumeric)
  will be ignored. If the key is ambiguous then the next matching 
  entry will be selected at each repeated key-press.
- Mag!X from version 1.01 is supported. In this case Selectric¿ no 
  longer hangs in the traps and is also present when calling 'Load...'
- The return of a group of file names has been extended by one 
  procedure. It operates in a similar way to Fsfirst/next.
- A TT with NVDI appears to be too fast :-). Oh well, following this 
  discovery some brakes were built into Selectric¿'s slider handling. 
  If one additionally presses the right mouse key (even afterwards) 
  then the full-speed mode is re-activated.
- During manual path input one can input commas, for instance, even 
  without 'Let 'em Fly!' installed.
- The attempt to create a new item without a name is now intercepted 
  immediately, and no longer by TOS itself.
- Due to a small keying error the minutes in the File/Folder Info 
  were displayed incorrectly.
- Sorting 'by Date' now also makes use of the file name if necessary.
- The Disk-Info bombed out if the partition had a size of 0 Bytes. 
  This -- actually nonsensical -- value has appeared up to now only 
  in connection with the virtual drives of MiNT.
- Under certain condition one could make Selectric¿ crash while 
  inserting(!) characters into file names.
- Over-long title lines on the main page are now truncated. 
  Previously output was only cut short at the edge of the dialog box.
- If the flags or name was changed via 'Info' then in some cases the 
  file window was not correctly updated (e.g. if changing a name to 
  one the mask no longer fits).
- During the Search function clicking on the 'Interrupt process?' box 
  unfortunately had no effect, i.e. even with 'Yes' the search 
  continued.
- If during 'Copy: Select destination path' a file was also confirmed 
  with a double-click, then Selectric¿ became 'somewhat' confused. 
  Now the double-click is ignored, i.e. one must continue 
  confirmation with 'OK' or RETURN/ENTER.
- Attempts to Move/Copy a file onto itself will now be intercepted. 
  Otherwise the file could/would be deleted.
- Path input without specifying the drive no longer simply takes the 
  current path and current drive now; instead the path input is 
  extended by the (current) drive.
- The testing of non-existent paths has now been made TOS-proof. 
  Previously it didn't always work properly (see old instructions).
- New malloc routines (thanks Stefan and Gereon!). With this TT-RAM 
  is now allocated as a preference. In addition smaller blocks (4K) 
  are now requested from TOS so that one can work better when memory 
  is short.
- The Install-portion has been revised.

Version 1.03
------------
- Not much has happened here. In any case, now that Oliver Scheel 
  has withdrawn from Selectric¿, his name has been mostly removed 
  from the program at his request.
- The bug that was responsible for inputs of relative paths with a 
  drive -- for instance "H:TEXTS\*.TXT" -- not being expanded 
  correctly has been removed. Now the current path is inserted.
- In the 'New items' dialog one can no longer input any wild-cards.
- Also new is the fact that now there is no difference between 
  registered and unregistered versions. The unregistered version can 
  now be transformed into a registered version via a dialog that is 
  accessible via the Info-dialog. For this one only needs a key. 
  Here I would like to thank Wolfgang "CoNnect" Wander, from whom I 
  got the idea.

Version 1.03 Maxi
-----------------
- This version differs from 1.03 only in that instead of 8 entries 
  it shows 16.
  

Version 1.10
------------
- The first supported English version.
- The number of files displayed changes automatically depending on the 
  current screen resolution. This ranges from 8 files in ST high, through 
  12 files with OverScan up the maximum of 24 files using TT high and some 
  graphic cards. Each time Selectric¿ is called it checks the current 
  resolution and displays the appropriate number of files. Ideal for 
  Autoswitch-OverScan users.
- At the request of one of my Beta testers (Hello Dirk!), who couldn't 
  cope with 24 lines at the same time, the number of lines is now 
  user-definable in the Options dialog. Depending on your resolution it's 
  possible to select between 8, 12, 16 and 24 lines.
- All graphics are now handled by the MultiTOS AES.
- The Sort by date option has been extended to sort files with the same 
  datestamp using the timestamp. Previously such files were listed 
  alphabetically.
- The Option dialog contains an option to 'Show time for todays items'.
  When this option is selected any file with todays datestamp will display 
  the timestamp instead. A small clock symbol denotes such entries.
- Bug in the Registration dialog removed. Names longer than 26 Bytes could 
  bomb Selectric¿. The fault was discovered by Johannes G”ttker-Schnetmann
  8-)
- Registered users can re-display their key, after it has been entered. 
  Click on the Name field or press the [HELP] key.
- The annoying dialog after pressing [CTRL]+[U] has been removed. This 
  option now exits Selectric¿ as if the 'Cancel' button had been selected. 
- The Auto locator can no longer be switched off.
- An error in conjunction with the Mag!X Installation routine fixed.
- The routine to Save the Options in SLECTRIC.PRG itself has been 
  scrapped. The Options are now always saved as SLECTRIC.INF.
