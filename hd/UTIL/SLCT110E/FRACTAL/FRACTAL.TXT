Fractal - The memory fragmenter

Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Unfortunately there are still programs around which grab all the available 
memory instead of dynamically allocating and releasing memory as they need 
it. Such programs prevent programs like Selectric, FuzzyClock and Let 'em 
Fly etc from operating properly.

Fractal partially resolves this problem by taking advantage of the fact 
that the operating system only allocates ajacent memory blocks to programs. 
Fractal switches off a user-definable sized memory block which prevents 
memory grabbing programs from reserving the entire memory. This memory is 
then available to other Applications.

Naturally this is not the optimum solution to this Problem and there's no 
guarantee it will work in every situation.
It would be much better if programmers refrained from this arcane 
practice. It's not only cleaner but is the only way such programs will 
ever run sucessfully in a multitasking environment.
 
Fractal consists of the following files: 
 
    FRACT016.PRG       Fractal set to reserve 16 Kilobytes 
    FRACTAL.TXT        This file 
 
 
Distribution and conditions of use 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Fractal is Freeware and can be freely passed between end users. Permission 
to distribute Fractal over BBSs is given and encouraged.
PD libraries, magazines or any other organisations may only distribute 
Selectric¿ with my written permission.

The following PD/Shareware libraries obtained my permission to carry 
Selectric¿:

The FaST Club; 7 Musters Road, Nottingham, NG2 7PP, England 
 
 
Installation 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Simply copy Fractal into the Auto folder on your boot disk/partition and 
after a reboot the memory will be fragmented.
The size of the memory block reserved is adjustable between 1 and 999 
Kilobytes. To change the size of the reserved memory block rename Fractal 
using the last three characters of the filename to indicate the desired 
size:
 
FRACT016.PRG     -Reserves 16Kb
FRACT001.PRG     -Reserves 1Kb
FRACT128.PRG     -Reserves 128Kb
FRACT999.PRG     -Reserves 999Kb

Important! Always run Fractal from the AUTO folder and not from the 
desktop!
