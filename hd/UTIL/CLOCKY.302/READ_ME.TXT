Hi All,

Clocky 3.02F has just been released.

This archive contains a SETCLOCK v3.12 with bugfix for $HOME var.

Nearly two years after previous Clocky 2.37 release - you may ask "why it
took so long?". The answer is simple: dozen of great improvements,
completely rewritten GEM configuration tool and more than six months of
really hard beta tests. This is really the most tested, bugfree and stable
version of Clocky I ever released!

What can you do: First, there's no plain text documentation. ST-Guide
hypertext rules. I am sure you have ST-Guide installed, if no go get it and
install it first. This is a must, believe me.

Next, copy the CLOCKY.HYP from DOC folder to your hypertext folder.
Do it, please, because SetClock will call ST-Guide for help.

Now read it. You want read it because I spent so much time writting it.
Yes I know, people never read docs until something fails. Read it anyway.

OK, so how to install it if you don't read the doc even if I asked you
to do it? Simply:

1) copy AUTO\CLOCKY.PRG into your AUTO folder

2) copy content of JCLKTOOL folder to root of your boot drive (C:\)

3) copy SETCLOCK folder somewhere to your UTILS folder

4) run SETCLOCK.APP

Once you are in SetClock III you may press Help and read the doc. Or maybe
you are a stone-age user of Clocky and knows it like your shoes? I doubt
that, there were too many enhancements I did in last two years. You should
at least read the "What's new" section of the doc (which is not complete
anyway, but at least it gives the picture).

I'll eventually come back and improve the documentation. I'll sure try
to fix any bug you may find. Feel free to send me e-mail or something.

And now, enjoy Clocky!
