[E]xternal [H]otkeys [C]lient library
-------------------------------------

This small library provides a simple interface to Clocky's external
hotkeys (see the Clocky docs for more information). Feel free to
use/spread/modify/whatever this library.

Note: This library needs Clocky v.2.20 or newer. It will not compile
with earlier versions of jclktool.h.


Example code
------------

First you must initialise the library:

	int hotkeysActive;

	hotkeysActive = initHotkeys();

initHotkeys() returns either a negative number (initialisation failed)
or a positive number (initialisation OK).

Then register the hotkeys you want to use. Note: The hotkey-functions
always work with *scancodes*, but there are two functions in the
library to convert between ascii and scancode, scan2ascii() and
ascii2scan(). See ech-lib.h for details.

	registerHotkey(0x0f);            /* TAB */
	registerHotkey(ascii2scan('p')); /* p */

If the hotkey is already registered by another application, this
function will return 0, otherwise a positive number.

Use the function checkHotkeys() to check for pressed hotkeys. The following
piece of code is usually triggered by a timer-event.

	char hotKey;

	if (hotkeysActive)
		if ((hotKey = checkHotkeys()) != 0)
		{
			/* First we checked for keys with no ASCII-value */
			hotKey &= 0xff;		/* filter out shift keys */
			switch (hotKey)
			{
				case 0x0f:	/* TAB */
					do_something();
					break;
			}

			/* Then we check for characters */
			hotKey = scan2ascii(hotKey);
			switch (hotKey)
			{
				case 'p':	/* p */
					do_something_else();
					break;
			}
		}

When your application exits, you should free your registered hotkeys
with the following call:

	removeHotkeys(-1);

If you pass -1 as parameter, all you registered hotkeys will be
removed. If you for some reason want to remove one specific hotkey,
kall removeHotkeys() with the scancode of this key as parameter.

That's it...
