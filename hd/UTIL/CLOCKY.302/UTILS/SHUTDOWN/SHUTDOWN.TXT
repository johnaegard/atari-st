Hi,

SHUTDOWN.C (and SHUTDOWN.PRG) was written for MiNT+N.AES users. N.AES comes
with N.Closure, fine program for graceful shutdown of system. MiNTOS (KGMD)
does fsck (checking disk filesystem) on every startup unless file
/etc/fastboot is found. This file should be created when system goes down.
Since N.Closure doesn't create this file, I write the SHUTDOWN program for
this. It just creates the file and launches N.Closure (defined in SDMASTER
env. variable in default N.AES setup).

The beauty of Clocky and JCLKTool is that the usual hotkey combination
Alt-Control-Q is intercepted by Clocky and JCLKTool starts SHUTDOWN.PRG.
This in turn starts N.Closure, so for user *nothing changes*, just the next
boot is much faster (because fsck is skipped).
