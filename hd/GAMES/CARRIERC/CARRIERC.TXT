  Carrier Command for Atari ST

Works from hard disk (or floppy) on any ST(E), Falcon.

If 1MB or more RAM is in machine will load sampled
music in top RAM, and play it if wait about  min.
at intro screen (rotating carrier).

Still small problem with Falcon and
'Load old game' - looses cursor.
