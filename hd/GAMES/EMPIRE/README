General Notes on Red Lightning:

As of this writing, there have been no changes to the rules. 
There are no known bugs.

Due to production constraints, it was not possible to include a 
complete Order of Battle (a list of units used in the game) in 
the rules manual.  Since many players will miss this info, A 
very complete Order of Battle is included as an ASCII file on
your Scenario disk.  The file is labeled OB.ASC.  Feel free to
print this file for reference.  This will generate a large
printout.  You might want to examine or edit it before printing.

On the ST, you may examine or print this file out directly from
the desktop by simply clicking on the filename.

On IBM compatibles, you may TYPE the file for examination or
PRINT the file from DOS.  See your DOS manual for details.

On the Amiga, you may examine the file using MORE or print it
using PRINTFILES.  See your DOS or Enhancer manual for details.

Of course, you may also print or examine the file by using any
word processor or text editor which can digest ASCII files.
This will also generally give you greater control over the 
appearance of the printout than is possible using the basic 
system utilities listed above.

Keyboard rosettes for use in illustrating the basic control
modes in the IBM version of the game are given below.
