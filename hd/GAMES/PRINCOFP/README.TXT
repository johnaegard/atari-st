Princ of Persia for Atari ST

Game was pretty poor coded - result: works not under TOS 2.06 or higher ones. There is some ROM dependent code for keyboard reading. There is a lot of  move.b ... instead  move.w ... commands before  ..(An,Dn.w)  commands.  From some reason it worked well under TOS 1.0x . But not under higher ones - result of such coding was: not finding game files, damaging own code, bad room drawing by play... and who knows what other more...

This is Gamex, GOS4 adapted version,
and game works well under higher TOS
versions and on Falcon.

Min RAM is 1MB. Then run with 
START.TOS. However, sound will
be better with more RAM, so if have 
2MB or more run with START2M.TOS.

Added trainer option.
When asks to drink potion - by manual,
drink any, and will proceed...
Selectable start level. 7 is not
selectable (will see why, when play).
Level 13 is final of level 12 actually.
