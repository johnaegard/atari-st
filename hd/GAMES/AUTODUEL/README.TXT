    Auto Duel   for Atari ST

HAGE version - works on all ST(E), Mega ST(E),
any TOS.  1 MB RAM min .


By pressing M at HW detect screen may enter
machine setting option - only with Mega STE.

Exit to Desktop, savestates options.

After start, press space right when title screen starts,
otherwise will stuck with nasty sound. Some incompatibi-

to deal with.
