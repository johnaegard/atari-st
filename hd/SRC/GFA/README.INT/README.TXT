RSC.PRG

The Resource Construction Set program RSC2.PRG has been added  to 
this disk by popular demand and is for information only.  We were 
unable  to obtain the authority to document this program.  It  is 
not the best RCS program and crashes quite often.

You  can either obtain KRESOURCE from Kuma,  or  create  resource 
files  from  within  your  own  Basic  programs.  This  is  fully 
explained in the Software Development Book, available from GFA.

Resource  files  are  also  explained in  tutorial  form  in  the 
independent GFA User magazine.  Back issues of this magazine  can 
be obtained from GFA User, 186 Holland St, Crewe, Chesire.


IMUNE.PRG

Within the Autofolder of GFA Basic is a program called IMUNE.PRG.

This program will run automatically each time you boot and look
for any virus on the boot sector. If a virus is found, IMUNE will
remove the virus program from the boot sector.

To be sure of not contracting a virus, always do a cold boot 
with your ST if you have booted with a disc of unknown or suspect 
origin.

We hope that IMUNE.PRG will help give you some protection.
