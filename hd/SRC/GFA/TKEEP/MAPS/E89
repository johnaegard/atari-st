This is a very desolate place indeed.  It would be best to avoid it.
Indeed, the thought of the desolation inherent in this place scares me.

You thought the other place was haunting?  Let me tell you, the ground
on which you stand is truly the outhouse of the gods.  No question.

Now this, by comparison, is a truly friendly place.  Nice atmosphere.
