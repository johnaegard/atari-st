<b>Math with numbers</b>

a%=10+4*1-6/7  !for example, is converted into:

  moveq #13,d0
  move.l d0,adr_of_variable

That's quite an impressive optimization.

Say you are dealing with some structure, and you prefer to write like this for
clearity:
  <a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{struct%+0}=22
  <a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{struct%+4}=5  !etc...

The +0 in the first line generates no code at all when compiled.

<b>IF/ENDIF versus SELECT/CASE</b>

If you have an IF/ENDIF structure that does 2 or more tests on the same
variable, SELECT/CASE should be used. Why? Because SELECT/CASE holds the
value of the variable in a register for the entire structure, where as
IF/ENDIF fetches the value of the variable at each reference.

<hr>

<b>IF/ENDIF with Boolean tests</b>

<a href="#IF">IF</a> test!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>  !generates more code

<b>Quick flip flags</b>

How to flip a boolean variable (<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> or <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>) in one line of code:

How to flip a word variable used as a flag (0 or 1) in one line of code:
flag&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#BCHG">BCHG</a>(flag&amp;,0)

<hr>

<b>Variables versus Constants</b>

This is slower and generates more code:

    pdomain&amp;=281
    domain_mint&amp;=1
    result&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a>(pdomain&amp;,W:domain_mint&amp;)

This is faster and more compact when compiled:

    result&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a>(281,W:1)

Although the first example is easier to read, fetching the values of the
variables adds overhead.

<hr>

<b>Built in commands versus custom bindings</b>

If at all possible always use the built in commands. Built in commands pass
parameters via registers. User written routines on the other hand pass all
parameters via the stack, which is slower.

Normally you need to go to supervisor mode to get the cookie jar address. To
avoid that one can use this legal <a href="#BIOS">BIOS</a><a href="#()">()</a> call. This is the best method for
MiNT and works equally well under all versions of TOS.

<a name="fastload"></a>How to force a <a href="#fastload">fastload</a> on TOS 1.00/1.02 (exploit a bug in TOS)
______________________________________________________________________________

The binary must meet 2 requirements:
  1) No relocation data (must be 100% pc relative)
  2) The ABSFLAG in the header must be set to non-zero (word at offset 26)

The OS will load the file and relocate it.
Control will be passed to the binary like normal.

The OS fails to do 2 things (the bug)<a href="#:">:</a>
  The BSS and heap memory areas will not be cleared (thus its fastloaded)<a href="#.">.</a>
  The binary is not closed, it cannot be deleted or moved from the Desktop.

The binary should close itself before it terminates.
  If not, the system will have 1 less file handle available to other apps.
______________________________________________________________________________

To close the binary you have 2 options:

Method #1 (used in PinHead v1.4)
Call fsfirst() with "<a href="#*">*</a><a href="#.">.</a>*" in the current dir and open the 1st file you find.
Then simply close the file.
Now fclose(previous handle-1), the binary will then be closed.

Method #2 (used in DC Squish II v2.12)
Check the TOS version:
  If its TOS 1.00:
    If the word at offset $15D2 <a href="#=">=</a> $601A, then the next word is the handle.
  If its TOS 1.02:
    If the word at offset $1632 <a href="#=">=</a> $601A, then the next word is the handle.
  Call fclose() with the file handle, the binary will then be closed.

TOS 1.04 and up do not have this bug and also supports <a href="#fastload">fastload</a> directly.
______________________________________________________________________________

This technique is probably only useful in small \auto folder programs as it is
sort of hard to write a rather large application that has no fixups.

The information regarding this trick was discovered by dis-assembling the
above mentioned programs and studying the code. Tests were made with old
versions of TOS to verify the mysterious offsets mentioned as well.

The Atari Compendium mentions a bug related to the ABSFLAG and some versions
of TOS, but does not state the nature of the problem. Well, now I know.  ;o)

  PinHead Now Fastloads Itself!
  <a href="#-">-</a>----------------------------

       Version 1.4 of PinHead uses an undocumented feature of TOS 1.0 and
  1.2 to "<a href="#fastload">fastload</a>" itself.  This means that the speedup starts one
  program sooner in your AUTO folder, since the PinHead program file does
  not cause memory to be cleared when it runs.

       (NOTE: Normally, the use of this undocumented feature would result
  in the PinHead program file being left "open" by the system.  PinHead
  1.4 uses a special technique to avoid this bug in TOS, and you will have
  no trouble deleting, renaming, or copying the PinHead program file after
  it runs.)

From the DC Squish II manual, page 19, 1st paragraph:
  When the FAST bit is OFF, both the BSS and the HEAP
  memory areas are cleared. Early TOS versions, 1.0 and 1.2
  do not know about the FAST bit an therefore 'always'
  clear both the BSS and HEAP. There is a trick to make
  <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> load files 'fast' on TOS 1.0 &amp; 1.2, and SQUISH
  uses this technique to allow fast-equivalent execution
  speed.

Hi Lonny!

L&gt;Does someone here know what "gfa" means in the title of "gfa-basic"<a href="#?">?</a> I
L&gt;have wondered this since the day I discovered version 2.x back in the
L&gt;days of the Atari 520st.

As far as I know, GFA (originally called "GfA") was a shortcut for
"Gesellschaft fr Anwendungssoftware mbH"<a href="#.">.</a> That means in english
(word by word)<a href="#:">:</a> "Company for application software Ltd." So GfA was
the name of the company, and GfA-Basic was the name of the software.

But in fact, this name ("GfA") was in conflict with the name of a
further organization. I can't remember which one it was. But due to
that, the company was renamed into "GFA Systemtechnik GmbH" which
means: "GFA system engineering Ltd." So from then, "GfA" was called
"GFA"<a href="#.">.</a> And "GFA" is now <a href="#-">-</a> AFAIK - only a symbol for the company that
sounds like the old shortcut, but without officially being a
shurtcut. Now, the basic also is called "<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>", not "GfA-Basic"
any longer.


Best regards!

Hi Lonny!

I'm not sure anymore if I'm right with "GF*A*" <a href="#=">=</a> "application
software" instead of "automation"<a href="#.">.</a>

Once I've asked the GFA support why "GfA" was renamed as "GFA" and Mr.
Lars von Str鑞en (Software Support, GFA Systemtechnik) replied:

<a href="#-">-</a>----
"GfA" was renamend as "GFA" in 1987. It happened, because the acronym
"GfA" was changed into the proper name "GFA-Systemtechnik"<a href="#.">.</a>

Dピseldorf, 1991-06-20
<a href="#-">-</a>---

The header shows:

GFA Systemtechnik GmbH
Software-Entwicklung, Software-Vertrieb, Verlag
Dピseldorf, Germany

This means:

GFA Systems Enginieering Ltd
Software Development, Software Sales, Publishing
Dピseldorf, Germany ;<a href="#-">-</a>)

CEOs are Mr. Thomas Nied and Dr.Ing. Heinrich Meckner

Later, GFA Systemtechnik GmbH moved to Mnchengladbach, another
town in western Germany.

But I found exactly ONE curious invoice in my documents. The header
here is:

GFA Systemtechnik GmbH
Industrie-Automation
Proze&#7885;leit-Systeme
Qualit鑼ssicherungs-Systeme

And THIS means:

GFA Systemtechnik GmbH
Industrial Automation
Process Control Systems
Quality Assurance Systems

Date: 1992-02-17

The address still is Dピseldorf, not yet Mnchengladbach. But the
local court is in Kiel (nothern Germany)<a href="#.">.</a> I really don't understand
what this means. Because the CEO is still Mr. Thomas Nied.

I found nothing about Thomas Nied in google. Dr. Meckner seems having
worked for Krupp (a big steel company), but for both I found no
reference where I could get in contact.

So it *is* possible, that GfA meant "Gesellschaft fビ Automatisierung"
(=automation), and not, as I heavyliy do remeber, "Gesellschaft for
Anwendungssoftware" (=application software)<a href="#.">.</a>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Origins_of_GFA-Basic">The Origins of GFA-Basic</h2>
THE ORIGINS OF GFA BASIC

It began with an Atari 400, a small computer similar to the Commadore 64.
There existed a BASIC for that computer.  This BASIC was neither fast nor
comfortable to use, but, with only 16K of RAM, large programs could not be
written anyway.  After upgrading the computer to 48K of memory and 88K of disk
space, I wrote some programs in assembly code.  Eventually I ended up with a
number of help routines, and a BASIC language with which I could marginally use
with these routines.  After trying FORTH, I decided to take a closer look at
BASIC, and slightly modified it.  These modifications eventually became so
numerous that I decided to completely replace many of the routines.  To remain
compatible, some of the routines were left untouched.  There were a lot of
commands I did not like, such as computed GOTOs, and line numbers were a
nuisance.

This new BASIC was published in a computer magazine.  Shortly thereafter I
received an offer from GFA Systemtechnik GmbH to write a workable BASIC for the
new computer, the Atari ST.

The Atari ST incorporates a fresh modern processor.  Its operating system,
although certainly not the newest or fastest (nor is it very compact, having
been written in C language) is very powerful.  And, even though it lacks
multitasking, one can write programs in high level languages that offer
exciting performance.

Shipped with a BASIC language that did not even measure up to the one included
with the Atari 400, the ST was destined to become a language developers dream.
It was possible to now develop a BASIC that did not have to conform to the
standard of any other interpreter.

This new BASIC should have the simplicity of BASIC combined with the
possibility of writing well structured code.  The first step was to eliminate
the line numbers.  This made the task difficult from the outset because a
solution had to be found to avoid the usual confusion of GOTOs and GOSUBs.  It
was important to be able to pass parameters to procedures and to declare local
variables, thus enabling the programmer to use recursive programming
techniques.  The BASIC should also make sure that all loops are properly closed
before the program starts execution.

The <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a> statement was one of the last statements added to this BASIC.  After
much thought, I even allowed the <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a> command to be used between different
procedures.

In an Interpreter it is possible to use segmented PEEKs and POKEs to simulate
one of the Intel-processors.  In a compiled program, this would greatly affect
execution time.

The unsuitable 16 bit integers would not be used either, as this makes it
harder to address all of the memory.  Besides, the processor already uses 32
bits internally, thus allowing it to process larger numbers without speed loss.

The editor of this BASIC had to be screen oriented and not use the windows of
GEM.  It would be virtually impossible to create non GEM programs from within
the GEM interface.  Other reasons exist for not having the editor run under
GEM.

In the case of a program error, it is often possible to save program changes
that were made.  Something that cannot always be done from within GEM because
the windows lock up.  So it happened that a relatively fast editor, one that
could be used without a mouse, was created.

I wanted to write the BASIC completely in machine language so that it would be
fast and take up only a small portion of memory.  Other languages like C use
only a few machine instructions outside of the library, and they always pass
parameters through the stack.  The MC68000 has a very powerful instruction set
that can be better utilized with an Assembler.

Taking all this into consideration, Version 1.0 of <b>GFA BASIC</b> came into
existence less than 6 months later.

While I was writing the interpreter, I carefully made sure that the finished
programs could be easily compiled.  That is why the MERGE command is missing.
This command may be useful in an interpreter, but is of little value in a
compiler.

While I was working on the compiler, I was confronted with requests to expand
the command set.  Some of those requests I was able to incorporate in Version
2.0 of the interpreter.  Most new commands, like <a href="#VOID">VOID</a>, <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a>, and <a href="#OPTION">OPTION</a>,
were inserted to give the compiler more optimization opportunities, and to
provide the programmer with more control over the compiling process.

Even an extensive computer language cannot fulfill all the wishes of everyone
who uses it.  This book will, therefore, show you how to create necessary
routines using <b>GFA BASIC</b><a href="#.">.</a>

This book does not present you with complete applications; it gives routines
that can be incorporated into your own programs.

<b>GFA BASIC</b> is only a BASIC and not a Modula 2, therefore you cannot
create modules in quite the same way.  Modula 2 takes a lot more coding and a
multitude of small modules to write an application.  Modula 2 can only be used
as a compiler.  BASIC includes numerous commands that would have to be created
within libraries in Modula 2.

Part of this book discusses many different operating system routines which
include examples wherever I felt they were needed.  Naturally, there are
routines that can be run directly without going to the low-level operating
system routines, but rather with built in commands.

An important part of this book is the last chapter, where a complete GEM
program is shown.  It demonstrates how to use all parts of a window.  This is
not easy to do in GEM, but it makes it convenient for the user of the program.
For the programmer, GEM always means extra work.  There are many programs where
most of the code is written just to manipulate the window.

I hope that you find the routines and tips in this book useful, and I wish you
much success.

should also be noted that this patch removes the auto mouse hiding/showing that
takes place when graphics commands are used. Once patched you must hide/show

This patch replaces many routines in the GFA library file. From what I can tell
from the German docs it adds automatic FPU support among many other things. An
impressive update to the GFA library. The patch seems to require an original
German v3.6TT compiler/linker package.

<b>Patchable areas in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a></b>

Within GFABASIC.PRG and GFABASRO.PRG there is a small area where you can
predetermine the appeareance of the program.

Always ensure that you have made a backup of your master disk before attempting
such patches.

<b>Auto Clear Screen</b>

    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "U",#1,"GFABASIC.PRG" !or "GFABASRO.PRG"
    <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> #1,31
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #1,"E"<a href="#;">;</a> !or "H";
    <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #1

With "E" the monitor screen will be erased before the program starts and with
"H" the monitor is left as it is.

<b>Autorun Patch </b>

    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "U",#1,"GFABASRO.PRG"
    <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> #1,32
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #1,"TESTPROG.GFA"<a href="#;">;</a><a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(0);
    <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #1

When starting GFABASRO.PRG the default TESTPROG.GFA will start if you do not
alter this by using the Install Application option of the GEM Destop.

The program's name and path may not exceed 63 bytes. The zero byte at the end
of the string is very important. If you only give the zero byte, the original
status will be reimplemented.

<b>Variable Default Type</b>

    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "U",#1,"GFABASIC.PRG"
    <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> #1,32
    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i%=0 TO 24

    <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> 0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is possible to change the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> row. Doing this will alter the preset
default-type for the variable, the name of which starts with the above letter.

Only the following values are allowed:

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Known_problems_with_GFA-Basic">Known problems with GFA-Basic</h2>
Features not implemented due to it's age and lack of support:

FPU 68881/882 (sort of)
CPU 68010/020/030/040/060 support

Things just act plain weird:

<a href="#~">~</a><a href="#INP">INP</a>(2) will fail under MiNT if the application does not initialize the <a href="#AES">AES</a><a href="#.">.</a>
The GFA linker in some cases is smart enough to link only what's needed.
If your application makes no <a href="#AES">AES</a> calls it will not initialize the AES.
Further investigation shows that any command that uses Bconin() fails
to wait for input.

This section will try and explain what happens when GFABASIC starts and
terminates. The code you can't really control.

The basic layout of a compiled GFA program is like so:

INIT module
your code
EXIT module

What does the INIT module do exactly:

  Calculates how much BSS space it needs and clears it.
  Moves the stack pointer to the BSS.
  <a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a><a href="#()">()</a> is called.  Skipped if started as an ACC, OS auto shrinks an ACC)
  <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> Init is called.  This is harmless, used by the Line-A gfx commands.
  <a href="#APPL_INIT">APPL_INIT</a><a href="#()">()</a> is called.  The appl_id is saved.
  <a href="#V_OPNVWK">V_OPNVWK</a><a href="#()">()</a> is called.  The vdi_handle is saved. No clipping rectangle is set.
  <a href="#WORK_OUT">WORK_OUT</a><a href="#()">()</a> array is created.
  Default <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> workstation values are setup.
  If any GFA window commands are linked, <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a><a href="#()">()</a> structure is initialized.
  <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a>($Mxxx) is called. If $Mxxx=0 all ram is allocated for stings/arrays.
  <a href="#CLEAR">CLEAR</a> is called.  All Variables are cleared.
  <a href="#RESTORE">RESTORE</a> is called.  First <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statement is located for <a href="#READ">READ</a>.
  User code starts here...

What does the EXIT module do exactly:

  User code ends here with <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>, <a href="#QUIT">QUIT</a>, or <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a><a href="#.">.</a>..
  If any GFA window commands are linked, all open GFA windowd are closed.
  <a href="#V_CLSVWK">V_CLSVWK</a><a href="#()">()</a> is called.
  <a href="#APPL_EXIT">APPL_EXIT</a><a href="#()">()</a> is called.
  <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> (no parameter) is called.  All open files are closed.
  pterm() is called.  User error code is passed out via SYSTEM/QUIT.

  Note:
  GFA deos not call <a href="#MFREE">MFREE</a><a href="#()">()</a> as it assumes pterm() will auto free the ram.

<b><a href="#Introduction">Introduction</a></b>
This document describes a method for debugging when all else fails and all you
have to go on is the crash log MiNT dumps in the console.  Sometimes you can
simply add <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> statements at various points in the program in order to narrow
your search.  However sometimes this becomes rather tedious, especially in very
large programs.  In some extreme cases I've actually seen programs suddenly stop
crashing simply by adding <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> statements.  Needless to say that is a very
frustrating situation if that happens.  The method described here will help you
locate the exact <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> or <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> in a more precise manner.  Hopefully
saving you time which can be put to better uses, like coding more applications.
:o)

Note: The particular example presented here is not an actual crash log from a
compiled <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program, however all the same principles apply.


<b>Understanding the crash log</b>
Firstly one needs to understand the information MiNT is trying to provide when
an application crashes.  A typical crash log might look like this:

PROCESS "make_ndx" KILLED: MEMORY VIOLATION. (PID 021) Type: free
PC: 0050A128  Addr: 0090BFD4  BP: 0050A000

Note: The example used here is a an application that crashes only when MiNT's
memory protection (MP) is enabled.  All values are in hex notation.


The log entry breaks down like this:

<u>Entry                           Description</u>
PROCESS "make_ndx"              name of the program that crashed
KILLED: MEMORY VIOLATION        the reason the program was killed
(PID 021)                       <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> Process ID of the program
Type: free                      type of memory block accessed
PC: 0050A128                    address of Program Counter
Addr: 0090BFD4                  address it attempted to access
BP: 0050A000                    <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a> address of the program

Type can have one of the following entries:

<u>Type            Description</u>
private         owned by another application
global          remapped to 'hardware' for violation reports
super   only    accessible in supervisor mode only
readable        read only, writing not allowed
free            free memory, has no owner
hardware        memory not controlled by MiNT

This represents the type of memory block the application attempted to illegally
access.  This can be an important clue.

Note: Information taken from file mprot.x on the MiNT <a href="#CVS">CVS</a> server.


<b>Interpreting the crash log</b>
The most interesting pieces of information here are the PC and BP values.  With
a little math we can determine the exact offset into the binary where the crash
occurred.

<a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> <a href="#=">=</a> PC <a href="#-">-</a> (BP <a href="#+">+</a> 256)

This is accomplished by subtracting the <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a> <a href="#+">+</a> 256 from the Program Counter.
Adding 256 to the <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a> accounts for the size of the BASEPAGE itself.  We are
not interested in the <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a> because it will not be included in the
disassembly.

In the above example we get this:

$0050A128 <a href="#-">-</a> ($0050A000 <a href="#+">+</a> $100) <a href="#=">=</a> $28    !hex
5284136 <a href="#-">-</a> (5283840 <a href="#+">+</a> 256) <a href="#=">=</a> 40          !decimal

We now know that at offset $28 (40) in the binary is where the crash actually
occurred.


<b>I know the offset, now what?</b>
The next step would be to recompile the application with the <a href="#Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</a> option
set to on.  This allows TTDigger (TTD) to show much more detailed information
when disassembling a program.  All the <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> and <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> names in the
program will be visible in TTD starting with an underscore.  Some examples:

<u><a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>                  TTD</u>
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> test              _TEST:
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> dump_tree(addr%)  _DUMP_TR:
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> init_system      _INIT_SY:
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> go(x&amp;,y&amp;)        _GO:

Only the first 7 characters of <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> and <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> names will be shown.
Entry points (labels) for <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> and <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> names are always aligned to
the left edge of the window and followed by a colon.

Note: The 7 character limitation within the <a href="#Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</a> is actually part of
the DRI Object File Specification.


<b><a href="#Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</a> warning</b>
The <a href="#Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</a> will make the binary larger.  It is also recommended you do
not leave this option on all the time.  Distributing binaries with the Symbol
Table serves only hackers, and it makes reverse engineering your application
quite a bit easier.  So always remember to disable the <a href="#Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</a> option when
you are done debugging!


<b>Using TTD</b>
Now start TTD and load your application.  Scroll down to the offset which you
calculated earlier ($28)<a href="#.">.</a>  Once you locate the offset, you can see the assembler
instruction that actually caused the program to crash.  Now scroll up to the
first label that begins with an underscore "_"<a href="#.">.</a>  This should be the <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a>
or <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> your program was executing when it suddenly came to a grinding halt.
Note: TTD can be set to work in Hex or Decimal mode.

It's possible the offset does not lie in the range of your application.  This
can happen if you are loading and executing external modules or overlays.  If
this happens you can apply the same techniques to the module or overlay.
However if you are not the author of the module or overlay, you probably won't
have access to the source code and thus cannot resolve the problem yourself.


<b>Another tip that might help</b>
If you suspect your program is crashing outside of a <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> or <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> you
can add some markers that are easy to spot in TTD.

Examples:       dummy$<a href="#=">=</a>"XXXX"
                dummy$<a href="#=">=</a>"<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>&gt;&gt;&gt;"

The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Compiler converts 4 character strings directly into  code instead
of placing them in the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment of the binary.  Thus they will appear in the
TTD listing exactly where you place them in your source code.

Note: Turn on the HEX/ASC option in TTD.

Note: This is only a partial listing.  The actual listing is much larger, but
its not really needed to illustrate the problem.  Comments added for clarity.

$028 <a href="#-">-</a> $034     <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a> call     -<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> free_ram%=MALLOC(-1)


<b>Understanding the problem</b>
From the listing we can determine the crash occurs very early on in the programs
start up phase.  We can see at offset $28 we have this:

move.l  <a href="##">#</a>$FFFFFFFF,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)

This one line of code simply tries to move (<a href="#LPOKE">LPOKE</a> if you will) the value -1 to
where ever the stack pointer is currently pointing. Why does this one line of
code bring our program to a grinding halt?

The answer in this case requires some basic knowledge of how MiNT starts up an
application.  The first thing MiNT does is allocate all available ram (largest
available block)<a href="#.">.</a>  It then creates a <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a> for the application in the first
256 bytes and following that is the actual code of the application.  By default
MiNT sets the user stack pointer to the end of the memory block.

This line of code is actually the program preparing for a <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a> call.  It is
attempting to inquire (-1) the largest free memory block.

What happens in this particular case is the program attempts to do the right
thing and give back memory it does not need with <a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a><a href="#.">.</a>  However, before doing
so it fails to move the stack pointer to a safe location inside it's own memory
space.  Remember the stack pointer by default is pointing to the end of the
memory block.  After the <a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a> call the stack pointer is literally left
pointing out into free memory!  As soon as the <a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a> succeeds the memory is
no longer owned by the application and under no circumstances will MiNT allow
you to access memory you do not own when MP is enabled.  The program is
instantly killed as a result.  This is a huge mistake on the part of the
programmer, if not downright sloppy programming.

There you have it, a way to let MiNT help you debug your programs.

<hr>

Constructs like this do not work in GFA:
  a=b=c=2

  In 'C' this sets all variables to the value of 2.
  GFA interprets this as a logic comparison and it must be recoded:
    a=2
    b=2  !assigned individually
    c=2

<b>The <a href="#?">?</a> <a href="#.">.</a>.. <a href="#:">:</a> ... operator</b>

The <a href="#?">?</a> <a href="#.">.</a>.. <a href="#:">:</a> ... operator is a sort of shorthand if...else... statement.
Because it is a little cryptic, it is not often used, but the basic form is as
follows:

(condition) <a href="#?">?</a>  expression1 <a href="#:">:</a> expression2;

The program evaluates condition. If it is true (not zero), then expression1 is
returned; otherwise, expression2 is returned.

For example, in the short program below, the line
bas <a href="#=">=</a> (foo <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> bar) <a href="#?">?</a> foo <a href="#:">:</a> bar;
assigns foo to bas if foo is greater than bar; otherwise, it assigns bar to
bas.

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
  int foo <a href="#=">=</a> 10;
  int bar <a href="#=">=</a> 50;
  int bas;

  bas <a href="#=">=</a> (foo <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> bar) <a href="#?">?</a> foo <a href="#:">:</a> bar;

  printf("bas <a href="#=">=</a> %d\n\n", bas)<a href="#;">;</a>

  return 0;
}

The program will print bas <a href="#=">=</a> 50 as a result.

Another example:
  x <a href="#=">=</a> (x&gt;0) <a href="#?">?</a> x <a href="#:">:</a> -x

  translates to:

  <a href="#IF">IF</a> x&gt;0
    x=x
  <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>
    x=-x
  <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

  which basically is the same as x=<a href="#ABS">ABS</a>(x)

Hi Lonny!

Sorry for german writing! But, I'm a bad english writer. <a href="#;">;</a>)

LP&gt; I have been looking for such info for ages!

Ich hatte mal vor ca. 10 Jahren (in einem Bツherladen) in irgendeinem Buch
(ich glaube es war von Data Becker) gebl鑼tert. Und darin war auch das
Format der GFA-Fliesskommazahlen beschrieben und ein Hinweis darauf, da&#7885;
das irgendeinem *IEEE*-Standard (wie auch die FPU-Datentypen) entsprechen
soll.
Suche also mal nach "IEEE" (die genaue Nummer und URL wei&#7885; ich leider nicht)<a href="#.">.</a>

LP&gt; Did you figure this out on your own?

Ja. Und zwar durch Analyse eines reassemblierten GFA-Compilats und durch
Vergleich mit den dokumentierten FPU-Datentypen.
Und die Richtigkeit der Analyse hatte ich dann nochmal mit einem Beispiel-
Programm (was ich dir gepostet habe) ッerprデt.
Ach, ja. Da fehlen am Ende eigentlich noch einige Zeilen:

  result#<a href="#=">=</a>(neg!^0*dual_value#)*2^exponent%
  <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "RES <a href="#:">:</a> "<a href="#;">;</a><a href="#STR$">STR$</a>(result#)

Hi Lonny!

LP&gt; I don't know any German, but lucky for me there is translators.  ;<a href="#-">-</a>)

Na, dann <a href="#.">.</a>.. Hauptsache wir verstehen uns.  <a href="#;">;</a>)

LP&gt; I have many books on GFA, but never found this info.

Tja, leider wei&#7885; ich nicht mehr, was das fビ ein Buch das war.  <a href="#:">:</a>(
Ich glaube es war _nicht nur_ ッer GFA.

LP&gt; I managed to add these myself after some test runs.  ;<a href="#-">-</a>)

Hab ich mir auch (fast) schon so gedacht.
Mit einem Calculator w鑽e das wohl auch nichts <a href="#.">.</a>..  ;)

LP&gt; In this line you reference the 'number#' itself.

Stimmt, ist ein wenig umst鈩dlich. Einfacherer w鑽e es so:  ;)
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{addr%+6}=1023
  dual_value#=number#

LP&gt; How would you figure out the floating point value of a float just
LP&gt; based on the 8 bytes stored in ram?

Hatte ich ja schon geschrieben: einmal durch Anschauen (im Compilat) wie
die Routinen von GFA z.B. ein Long in ein Float wandelt (oder auch <a href="#STR$">STR$</a>(n#)).
Und durch Vergleich mit den FPU-Datentypen. Die sind n鑪lich IEEE-Standard.
Und wenn die GFA-Floats auch IEEE sind, dann sollte das ziemlich 鑄nlich
sein.
Beschrieben werden die FPU-Datentypen z.B. im Buch "68030 Assembly Language
Reference" (von Steve Williams (Addison-Wesley)) unter dem Kapitel 4.2.1.2
"Floating Point Intructions"<a href="#/">/</a>"Binary Floating Point Data Formats"<a href="#.">.</a>

LP&gt; The files I have, I have no way to know the float value before hand,
LP&gt; if you follow me.

Nicht so ganz. Du willst wissen, wie die Bitwertigkeit der Mantisse ist?

<a href="#-">-</a>--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The program enclosed provides a convenient method of making useful patches 
to the GFA-BASIC 3.x interpreter and compiler.

At the start, select the Basic interpreter or compiler (GFA_BCOM.PRG). 
After that you will be taken to the settings dialog box.

Something in advance: Please take care not to save the patched program(s) 
under the same name as the original(s)<a href="#.">.</a> We accept no responsibility for the 
functionality of the patches, anyone who damages his own interpreter and 
does not have a backup, only has himself to blame!

<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler
<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Two changes can be made to the compiler or to the library:

<a href="#-">-</a> Insertion of an improved INIT section
<a href="#-">-</a> A bugfix for the crash under Mag!X

Both patches can be made individually or in one go. The Mag!X patch only 
changes the GFA_BCOM.PRG file, the INIT patch also updates the library.

In the patch dialog box, you can enter the new names that should be used to 
save the compiler and the library. If necessary, you can also use the 
original library again in case the preset name is not correct.

<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler 1: New INIT section
<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can get precise information about the new INIT section by reading the 
text file <a href="#LIBPATCH.TXT">LIBPATCH.TXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> The listing <a href="#ERR">ERR</a>.LST contains some examples of
how to use the new features.

Important: The LIBPATCH folder _must_ contain the files <a href="#HIDEM">HIDEM</a>.O, INIT35.O 
and INIT36.O!

Clicking on 'Patch' will start the automatic patching procedure. At the 
end, you should try to create a new <a href="#index">index</a> file (GFA3BLIB.NDX) using the 
program MAKE_NDX.PRG. This program (you should have received this with the 
original package containing the compiler) will search first in the original 
library folder and then in the folder LIBPATCH. If this fails, the file can 
still be chosen using the file selector. If this also fails, then the 
program will terminate. You should be aware that in this instance you will 
have to create an NDX file 'by hand'<a href="#.">.</a> If you can avoid this situation, so 
much the better.

Hint: If you do not have the MAKE_NDX.PRG program, you can obtain this from
GFA Systemtechnik (good luck with that) or send your original diskette and
a stamped, addressed return mailer to G. Duchalski and the adress mentioned
above.

<a href="#-">-</a>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the compiler II: MAG!X bugfix
<a href="#-">-</a>--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The compiler crashes under Mag!X with the message "Memory block destroyed"<a href="#.">.</a>
This is the cause:

The compiler uses MShrink (<a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> 74) to reduce its memory requirement as 
neccessary. Using Malloc (<a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> 72) it then checks for the largest 
available memory block and allocates this amount less 16 Kbytes. 
Unfortuantely, the program assumes fom this that the allocated memory lies 
directly after the area previously shrunk. In general this is true. Under 
Mag!X, it lies before the allocated memory block (the address that was 
returned by MAlloc) which is indeed the so-called MCB, 'Memory Control 
Block'<a href="#.">.</a>

This contains
<a href="#-">-</a> An identifier ('ANDR' or 'KROM' a greeting to one of the programmers
<a href="#-">-</a> The length of the allocated block
<a href="#-">-</a> The base page address of the program, to which the block belongs
<a href="#-">-</a> A pointer to the last MCB.

The GFA compiler overwrites the MCB. After the compiler terminates, Mag!X 
checks whether the chain of MCBs is still intact and then reports the error 
described.

By the way: This problem also occurs under MultiTOS. However, in this case 
it can be removed by simply setting the memory protection flags in the 
program header to GLOBAL.

Through the use of the patch, the GFA compiler no longer uses the first 
16 bytes lying after the MShrink memory block and therefore dose not 
overwrite an MCB. The behaviour of the compiler remains nevertheless 
incorrect, so that the area allocated does not unconditionally lie after 
that which is still in use by the compiler (although as a rule this is 
true)<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Patching the interpreter
<a href="#-">-</a>---------------------------------------------------------------------------

This provides either practical configuration patches, as documented
by GFA or the correction of errors.

Interpreters that can be patched:

 Version:     File length:

  3.6TT          104770
                 104766
                 104739
                 104597 (English version)
  3.5E           103510
                 103337 (English version)
  3.50           102519
                 102523
  3.07           92894
  
What will be patched in the interpreter?

 <a href="#-">-</a> No more LINEA calls:
   Also see <a href="#LIBPATCH.TXT">LIBPATCH.TXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> When moving the mouse in the editor you may get 
   some residual images, but not while a program is running.
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> No more <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> calls, that change the colors on the TT:
   GFA Basic make some errors with the internal setting and querying of the 
   screen colors, so that in resolutions like TT Medium, some colors are 
   changed after running the interpreter. This patch prevents this. Also 
   the command <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> will no longer have an effect. The better command 
   <a href="#VSETCOLOR">VSETCOLOR</a> should be used as a replacement.
   Hint: Please take note that additional patches made to the editor colors 
   in conjunction with the <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> patch will have no effect either!
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> MERGE will no longer abort when <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> 4 is encountered within the text:
   The interpreter normally aborts the merging of files at the 
   corresponding line when it encounters <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> 4 (EOT <a href="#==">==</a> End of trans-
   mission, CONTROL D, left arrow)<a href="#.">.</a> Under UNIX, <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> 4 is the <a href="#EOF">EOF</a> 
   character which was one of the greatest ambitions of GFA Systemtechnik. 
   This patch removes this disrupting behaviour.
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> <a href="#CALL">CALL</a> bug removed:
   The <a href="#CALL">CALL</a> command in interpreter version 3.6 D TT with a size of 104770 
   bytes does not work because of a typing error (movem.l a4/a6,<a href="#-">-</a>(sp)
   instead of movem.l a4-a6,-(sp)). The patch repairs this command.
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> Free system memory:
   When starting, the interpreter reserves all available memory for itself 
   apart from 16 Kbytes. This is especially a problem on non-TT machines 
   since too little memory is available for <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> and they refuse to 
   work. This patch allows you to set the amount of memory that will remain 
   free (e.g. 32Kbytes).

 <a href="#-">-</a> Activate 'New names'<a href="#:">:</a>
   The 'New names' option from the Basic's system menu will
   be activated automatically.
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> The <a href="#DEFLIST">DEFLIST</a> preset

 <a href="#-">-</a> The editor colors
   Hint: These do not work when the 'No more <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> calls' is active at 
   the same time.
   
 <a href="#-">-</a> The default variable type can be entered without Postfix.
   This is preset to Float.

 <a href="#-">-</a> No <a href="#CLS">CLS</a> when strating program
 
Patching is basically simple: Once you have selected the patches you 
require, select the "Patch.." button. The patched version of the 
interpreter will then be saved under a new name.

                   memory which remains free after starting the program can 
                   be changed. The default is 16 Kbytes the least that is

(I) General &amp; specific info for these patches

Moin,

GFABASIC has grown close to all of our hearts.  When I first got my ST, it was
the only programmming language that offered a really fast turn around time (edit
a program, test it, edit a....), a hyperspeed compiler/interpreter (in most cases
the compiler also created correctly fixed code!) a usable editor and could
usefully be employed on a 1Mb computer _without_ a hard drive. I suspect that
this was ther reson for the success of GFA BASIC.

In the course of time and particularly (but not only) in conjunction with
graphic improvements has GFABASIC shown some of its shortcomings. These library
patches correct some (serious) problems.

The library patches has already appeared in two versions as GFAL1030 and
improved in GFAL1072. I was then asked by Gregor Duchalski whether I did
not have the desire to contribute some of my own ideas to patch the interpreter
using a convenient GEM interface.

Since my patch program offered a convenient operating environment <a href="#AND">AND</a> because of
Gregor's involvement and the wishes of the GFABASIC MAUS group, I decided to do
this. This convinced me to develop my own GFA library that can be installed
using GFA_PTCH.

<a href="#+">+</a>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
What does the compiler patch part of GFA_PTCH offer?

<a href="#-">-</a> <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> patches are incorporated automatically!
<a href="#-">-</a> Clean Auto folder recognition
<a href="#-">-</a> Clean recognition of <a href="#accessories">accessories</a>
<a href="#-">-</a> In case the memory requested by $m does not exist, this can be recognized
<a href="#-">-</a> $U/$I bug in 3.6 removed!
  Important: I definately advise against the $I matter in particular. It is
  untidy or in fact lethal. Also, <a href="#$U">$U</a> can be critical. Wirth this Init part,
  $U/$I will run just as "dirty" or "uncertain" as before, apart from the fact
  that it does now actually run under 3.6.

<a href="#ERR">ERR</a>.LST demonstartes to you in an exemplary way all of the features. This also
uses <a href="#$I+">$I+</a> cleany in the case of the demo. Take note of the comments incorporated
in <a href="#ERR">ERR</a>.LST and the hints offered below!

<a href="#!">!</a>!! Part of the assembler code is ｩ GFA Systemtechnik

Changes made to either part are for personal use only. Modified copies may not
be re-distributed!

<a href="#+">+</a>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Since there was a great deal of work involved in developing these patches, If
you find them useful, a gift (of thanks) of <a href="#&gt;=">&gt;=</a> 10,<a href="#-">-</a> would show your appreciation
<a href="#:">:</a>-)

Alternatively, since I am a music fan, you can send me a cassette (Chrome
dioxide, Dolby B <a href="#-">-</a> prefferrably a TDK SA-X) containing some of your favourites.
All types from Classical vocal (Opera, Operetta etc.), Rock, Folk and Disco
(Bananarama, Sabrina) are welcome. I prefer lesser known groups/bands/
interpretations. I hope to get a flood of cassettes!!! <a href="#:">:</a>-)

<a href="#+">+</a>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
What does GFA_PTCH.PRG do <a href="#?">?</a>

<a href="#==">==</a> (a) patches the compiler

Attention: Programs created using a patched compiler will _NOT_ run with an
           original library!

<a href="#==">==</a> (b) Patches the library

In the strictest sense this is not a patch but an exchange of code.

<a href="#==">==</a> 9c) Creation of a new <a href="#index">index</a> file GFA3BLIB.NDX

MAKE_NDX.PRG must be used _unconditionally_, which creates a new GFA3LIB.NDX.
this ought to be used with GFA_PTCH.

You ought probably to save the old version of GFA3BLIB.NDX even though you
could re-create this at any time using MAKE_NDX.PRG with the old library.

Unfortunately, MAKE_NDX first appeared with version 3.5. Currently I am
unaware (even if you are) whether it could be included with this package
and I have queried this with GFA.  If it can't, I will probably write a
functional equivalent.

<a href="#==">==</a> (d) Patch the interpreter

You must _unconditionally_ patch the interpreter using GFA_PTCH.PRG. In
case your version of the interpreter has not been seen by us:

Replace the FIRST occurrance of $A00A and $A009 by $4E71. This _ought_ to
cause a crash. As a result of the patch: $E0C0 $A00A $4CDF as well as $0008
$A009 $246E.

This will produce "mouse droppings" when moving the mouse within the
interpreter editor, but not whilst a program is running (the clean nesting
of hidems/showms for <a href="#GRAF_MOUSE">GRAF_MOUSE</a> is taken for granted!)<a href="#.">.</a>


<a href="#+">+</a>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
In case you have further problems:

<a href="#-">-</a> Make a test with the original GFA3BLIB (<a href="#+">+</a> the previous GFA3BLIB.NDX).

Send me
<a href="#-">-</a> the INIT.O file for your library
<a href="#-">-</a> The exact version number/length of the library &amp; compiler.

This can be done simply by: Run INIT2DMP.PRG from the same folder as
GFA3BLIB which will produce a printable or E-mail-able file INIT.DMP.

<a href="#!">!</a>!! Make sure that you use your ORIGINAL library or a copy of it and !!!
<a href="#!">!</a>!! not one that has already been patched                            !!!


<a href="#+">+</a>+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
How do I work with it <a href="#?">?</a>

Please take a look at the <a href="#ERR">ERR</a>.LST file. I hope that will be enough. You
should then read through the question and answers section of this text. The
commands that you ought to avoid (e.g. the Line A patches), and you will
find many of the tips useful.

<a href="#+">+</a>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
BUGS:

Hopefully there are not too many

Still being worked on:

<a href="#ERR">ERR</a> appears when starting the interpreter not always when initialised to
zero.

Before you blame this INIT, please test it first using the orignal GFA3BLIB
(&amp; the previous GFABLIB.NDX).

(II) Questions &amp; answer section

QUESTIONS &amp; ANSWERS:

<a href="#+">+</a>++++++++++++++++++++
QUESTION:
I have taken your advice that <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> should not be used. Why is this so?
Therefore, how can I make my compiler library (GFA3BLIB) <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> free?

ANSWER:
Here is an extract from the 10th edition of the Profibook:

[Start of quote]

The architecture of the operating system certainly speaks against the usage
of <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> routinmes. These are used for display in the low-level <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> screen
driver. Using them prevents the possible usage of another (faster) screen
driver!

Also, <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> routines are only provided for ST modes (320*200, 640*200,
640*400)<a href="#.">.</a> Already, with 256 color graphics (special graphic cards or the TT
in 'low' resolution) the provisions of the <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> interface have been
exhausted (see COLBIT0 to COLBIT3)

[End of quote]

In case that was a sclear as mud: DON'T PANIC!

The deciding factor in all this will be that progams using <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> routines
will not run correctly with graphic cards! Ergo: Do away with it!

<a href="#*">*</a>** Take heed from a correct nesting of hidems/showms (via <a href="#GRAF_MOUSE">GRAF_MOUSE</a> <a href="#AES">AES</a>
78)<a href="#.">.</a> For each hide of a show, "droppings" will result. With the mouse not
switched on, when it already is, as is the rule when starting GEM programs,
there are no "droppings"<a href="#.">.</a>

QUESTION:
Where can I find information about GEM conformant programming?

ANSWER:
Tim Orens ProGEM. This text from 1985, which you should be able to find in
most mailboxes provides the best in 'Professsional GEM' programming. You
will find more in the book 'Vom Anf舅ger zum GEM-Profi' by Gebrder Geiss.
A little confused, but otherwise very good. As reference material, the
'Profibuch' by Jankowski/Reschke/Rabich, is undoubtedly irreplaceable.

<a href="#+">+</a>+++++++++++++++++++
QUESTION:
GFA already has good commands for using windows. What can these be used
for?

ANSWER:
I advise against using GFA's own window management routines. In previous
versions this is incorrect <a href="#-">-</a> today, who knows? Using the <a href="#AES">AES</a>, it is equally
as 'simple' or 'difficult'<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#+">+</a>++++++++++++++++++++
QUESTION:
Sometimes my program is no longer under my control. With the best will in
the world I cannot find any erros. What is happening and how do I find out?

ANSWER:
Use SysMon and TempleMon. You can find TempleMon in many mailboxes <a href="#-">-</a> SysMon
can be obtained directly from the author:-

Karsten Isakovic
Wilmersdorferstr. 82
1000 Berlin 12

At the time of the crash, you will at least be able to establish the last
used system call and possibly the bad parameter.

Another good possibility is to use the TRACE procedurename (seee the
manual)<a href="#.">.</a> When all of the lines that have been traced are written to a
previously opened file (<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #1,<a href="#TRACE$">TRACE$</a>) you will quickly be able to
localise the cause of the crash.

The Turbo-C/Pure-C debugger can be equally as useful when the program has
been translated into symbols.

There is an extensive unknown error that exists <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>'s own memory
management. This exists in all three versions.

Hint: add a <a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0) command (in conjunction with any string) liberally to
your code.

Try the following (after re-booting)<a href="#:">:</a>

This information was provided by Ingo Schmidt (from a book)<a href="#.">.</a>

Starting address of a memory block which GEM installs to manage the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a>
parameters. This list isn't valid for the Mega-TOS or Blitter-TOS. GFA V3.0
gives confused values here. However, in the standard ROM-TOS the parameter
block for the virtual workstation is at address &amp;H578C. That block also is 308
bytes long and has the same structure as <a href="#VDIBASE">VDIBASE</a><a href="#.">.</a> The VDIBASE is a copy of that
parameter block. So in V3.0 you can use the hardware address instead of
<a href="#VDIBASE">VDIBASE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#/*">/*</a> The original atarierr.h defined quite a few error codes which were
   either useless or non-standard.  Important codes such as EISDIR,
   ENOTEMPTY were missing, others were simply misunderstood (for example
   the usual EINVAL would really be an ENOSYS, EINVAL is not invalid
   function number but invalid argument) and especially in MiNT
   some error codes got really overloaded, for example ENOENT serves
   as ENOENT, ESRCH and ECHILD, or EACCES and EPERM were the same.

   The codes in this file try to find the closest equivalent for
   all error codes currently in use, marks some error codes as
   deprecated and tries to be fit for the future by defining all
   error codes that may be needed for future enhancement.

   EEXIST was returned.  The new behavior could cause compatibility
   problems since inproper implementations of recursive rm commands
   could rely on the old error code (85) being returned.

   This error can happen in a few different situations:

        <a href="#*">*</a> An operation that would block was attempted on an object that
          has non-blocking mode selected.  Trying the same operation
          again will block until some external condition makes it
          possible to read, write or connect (whatever the operation)<a href="#.">.</a>
          You can use `select' to find out when the operation will be
          possible.

          Portability Note: In many older Unix systems, this condition
          was indicated by `EWOULDBLOCK', which was a distinct error
          code different from `EAGAIN'<a href="#.">.</a>  To make your program portable,
          you should check for both codes and treat them the same.
          In C programs you should not use a case statement for that
          because that will trigger a compile-time error for systems
          where `EWOULDBLOCK' and `EAGAIN' expand to the same numerical
          value.  You should either handle treat it with preprocessor
          macros (test if they are equal or not) or use an if conditional.

        <a href="#*">*</a> A temporary resource shortage made an operation impossible.
          `fork' can return this error.  It indicates that the shortage
          is expected to pass, so your program can try the call again
          later and it may succeed.  It is probably a good idea to
          delay for a few seconds before trying it again, to allow time
          for other processes to release scarce resources.  Such
          shortages are usually fairly serious and affect the whole
          system, so usually an interactive program should report the
          error to the user and return to its command loop.  *<a href="#/">/</a>

<hr>

   <b>Symptoms:</b>
      The local variable never receives the <a href="#FN">FN</a> value returned. The
      system may hang at a later point in the program.

   <b>Description:</b>
      This problem arises when a function assigns a value to local
      variable and a <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> or <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a> occurs before the function
      returns.

   An example source is given below that explains how, and can
   diagnose if your version of GFA has this problem:

   <b>Some remarks to this:</b>
    <a href="#*">*</a> The fault occurs both in the interpreter and in the compiled
      code.
    <a href="#*">*</a> The fault occurs when assigning any local variable (numeric or
      string) a value from a function inside of which, at any
      sublevel, a <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> or <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a> statement is executed.
    <a href="#*">*</a> The fault does not occur when existing string elements in an
      array are reassigned. The error arises only when
      (re)dimensioning string or numeric arrays.
    <a href="#*">*</a> The fault does not affect local variables returned as a <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>
      parameter. Nor does it affect assignment to a global variable.

   <b>Analysis:</b>
      This is a memory management bug caused by how the function
      assigns a value to a variable. Any program which has functions
      and uses dynamic management of arrays has the potential for
      unexplained and seemingly random problems. Note that the
      problem is especially treacherous since the cause can be
      buried far below where the faulty assignment occurs, e.g. the
      assigning function may call a procedure which calls a
      procedure which calls a procedure which performs a <a href="#DIM">DIM</a><a href="#.">.</a>

   <b>Workaround:</b>
      A workaround to function assignment of a local variable, is to
      return the value using a <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-defined parameter in the call
      (i.e. using a procedure), or to have the function return to a
      global variable. Or to not use dynamic arrays, or at least
      carefully structure when and how they are changed.

   Evidently the function assignment involves an internal V:a&amp;
   reference being generated before executing the function call. The
   <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> command inside the function allocates global variable space
   for the array (the element pointers in the case of string arrays,
   the physical array in the case of numeric arrays), which pushes
   all existing local variables addresses. (See detailed notes on
   memory use, below.) This is a problem only because it occurs at
   runtime when we have a static address reference pending in the
   function. The return value is thus written to the old invalid
   address, and variable a&amp; itself, now at another address, is
   unmodified.

   Note that attempting to <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a> the array dimensioned in this
   situation will cause the system to hang, since when the function
   return assigned the value, the old address for a&amp; then points
   into a <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> structure belonging to the new array. Where it
   points when an existing array is erased or redimensioned is less
   obvious, as is what happens then.

   Furthermore, any local variable which is assigned <a href="#ABSOLUTE">ABSOLUTE</a> will
   in a case like this (incorrectly) behave as a global and not have
   its address moved, see below:


   <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> a&amp;,b&amp;
   <a href="#.">.</a>..
   b&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#ABSOLUTE">ABSOLUTE</a> V:a&amp;
   b&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#FN">FN</a> oh_oh
   <a href="#.">.</a>..

   <a href="#.">.</a>.. Variable b&amp; is not moved and so gets the new value.


   Note that the address of b&amp; is actually now invalid, and points
   into space reserved for the array.
   (V:a&amp;=V:b&amp; is no longer true!)

   This behaviour is quite unlike e.g. garbage collection (~fre(0)),
   where both variables are moved together and the relationship
   V:a&amp;=V:b&amp; holds true.

Rev 3  3/12/2018
_______________________

The manual is quite vague on this command and does not even state the parameter
is optional.

There's two ways to use <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a><a href="#.">.</a> Here's two examples that hopefully clarify its
use. It's the same function call written both ways. All the examples contain
<a href="#$F%">$F%</a> to force an integer return value, this is very important.

<a href="#'">'</a> example #1: with parameter
<a href="#'">'</a> GFA fills in the <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> array itself
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> graf_mouse(mode&amp;,ptr%)
  <a href="#$F%">$F%</a>     !gemsys never returns a float, yet another speed up
  <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>(0)=mode&amp;
  <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>(0)=ptr%
  <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> 78
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a>(0)
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

In this first example GFA takes the opcode and uses it as an offset into a
table, where it fetches all the values for <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> on its own. This reduces
the chance of a typo. This method works for any <a href="#AES">AES</a> call if the opcode falls in
the range of 10 to 131. The original library is only as up-to-date as the day
it was released, many of the newer <a href="#AES">AES</a> calls have null entries. This actually
produces a smaller binary. I like to refer to this method as 'short form'.

<a href="#'">'</a> example #2: with no parameter
<a href="#'">'</a> <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> values must be supplied
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> graf_mouse(mode&amp;,ptr%)
  <a href="#$F%">$F%</a>
  <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(0)=78
  <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(1)=1
  <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(2)=1
  <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(3)=1
  <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4)=0
  <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>(0)=mode&amp;
  <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>(0)=ptr%
  <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a>
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a>(0)
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

In the second example the <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> entries must be passed. You need some good
docs if you are going to code this stuff. It can be rather tedious. I call this
method 'long form'<a href="#.">.</a> This method must be used for any opcode over 131 or entries
in the table that are empty.

So how do you know if a given opcode has a correct entry in the <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> table?
For the original library that's easy. All the built-in calls such as APPL_xxx,
WIND_xxx, and so on have valid table entries because GFA itself uses this table
internally.

The updated library will has the following <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> table entries added:

    <a href="#appl_yield">appl_yield</a>
    <a href="#appl_search">appl_search</a>
    <a href="#appl_control">appl_control</a>
    <a href="#appl_getinfo">appl_getinfo</a>
    <a href="#menu_popup">menu_popup</a>
    <a href="#menu_attach">menu_attach</a>
    <a href="#menu_istart">menu_istart</a>
    <a href="#menu_settings">menu_settings</a>
    <a href="#objc_sysvar">objc_sysvar</a>
    <a href="#objc_xfind">objc_xfind</a>

    <a href="#shel_wdef">shel_wdef</a>
    <a href="#shel_help">shel_help</a>
    <a href="#form_popup">form_popup</a>

This brings the <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> table up to <a href="#N.AES">N.AES</a> v2 specifications. Bindings can then
be written in short form for these calls. The new range for <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> is 10 to
135.

Exotic bindings for MagiC, XaAES, and Geneva that go beyond opcode 135 will
have to be written in long form. I do not plan to increase the size of the
table any further.

I did a speed test using the same call, short form versus long form and only in
the editor is there a noticeable difference. Compiling the speed test yields
the same result for both methods.

I noticed with <a href="#N.AES">N.AES</a> its doesn't seem to care if you forget to set <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> 2
to 4 when using the long form. This is a side effect of the newer <a href="#AES">AES</a>
implementations and they seem to handle the input arrays differently than TOS.
I do not recommend omitting these parameters on older TOS versions. I did some
testing and found it will cause them to fail.

<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4) however appears to be an exception to the rule. Looking in the TOS
4.04 source code archive you will find that <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4) is not really used.
Whoever wrote the <a href="#AES">AES</a> dispatcher made <a href="#RSRC_GADDR">RSRC_GADDR</a><a href="#()">()</a> a special case, since its
the only call that uses <a href="#ADDROUT">ADDROUT</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> Bindings missing <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4)=blah will work
regardless. Have a look at file gembind.c in the TOS 4.04 archive.

I don't know if Mr. Ostrowski dis-assembled TOS or someone at Atari fed him
some inside info, but GFA since day one has never set <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4) for any of the
built in <a href="#AES">AES</a> calls.   ;o)

So, what can we conclude from all this? If you need to write a binding, try to
use the short form if <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> supports it as it will reduce your code size
without a speed penalty. If you must use the long form, don't bother setting
<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4) and save a few a bytes, Frank would be proud.  :D

_______________________________________________________________________________

After doing even further study in the dis-assembler it's still possible to
squeeze even more bytes and speed out of the long form if you must use it. Say
for example you want to use an XaAES call and thus a binding is required. Since
opcode 137 doesn't have a table entry you must use the long form.

<a href="#'">'</a> example #2: long form

This will shorten your binary by 6 bytes and technically it's faster. The line
<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(0)=13 produces a library call and some addition instructions whereas
<a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a> 137 produces just a MOVE.W #137,d0. You can also drop the line
<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(4)=0 and save a total of 14 bytes, but if you are paranoid about
compatibility you might not want to. <a href="#;">;</a>)

by <a href="#Lonny_Pursell">Lonny Pursell</a>
Rev 3  3/12/2018

Is it possible to shorten the bindings and/or squeeze more speed out of them?

Lets face it, the interface to the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> is clunky at best, but we are stuck with
it if we want to write clean GEM applications. Every little bit of speed gained
helps, especially when rendering text.

Perhaps like most beginners I found an archive of bindings on the internet.
They seemed to work and I assumed that was the proper way to write them and
have been doing so ever since. I never really bothered to study the manual,
which is ironic because it actually does explain <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> in detail. Here's a
typical binding as I would normally write one. Let's call this long form.

<a href="#'">'</a> example #1: long form
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> pcircle(x&amp;,y&amp;,r&amp;)
  <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(0)=11  !opcode
  <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(1)=3   !ptsin count
  <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(3)=0   !intin count
  <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(5)=4   !sub-opcode
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(0)=x&amp;
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(1)=y&amp;
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(4)=r&amp;
  <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a>
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

Here's the same binding written in what I call short form.

<a href="#'">'</a> example #2: short form
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> pcircle(x&amp;,y&amp;,r&amp;)
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(0)=x&amp;
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(1)=y&amp;
  <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(4)=r&amp;
  <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> 11,0,3,4  !opcode,intin count,ptsin count,sub-opcode
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

Yeah, Frank flipped the two middle parameters. ;o)

If you don't need the sub-opcode, just leave out. If you need some extra
<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> parameter beyond 5, which is rare, just add the appropriate
<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(a)=b line.

As you can see the <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a> array is completely omitted and passed in one line
of code. Is it really faster? I'm having trouble figuring that out as the
timer in aranym is utter crap. I get varying results, sometimes its faster,
sometimes its slow. <a href="#:">:</a>-P

Now if we look deeper at the resulting assembler output, I can safely say its
faster. <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(a)=b produces a library call, thus a BSR and some addition just
to set one element. So that's four BSR calls and some addition (<a href="#ADD">ADD</a>.W) before
we even get to the <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> call.

The variant with the parameters in one line converts all four parameters to
MOVEQ #x,dx and inside the <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> call it does MOVE.W dx directly to where it
needs to go, without using any addition. You also get a smaller binary.

Another interesting study is <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(a)=b. Although these built-in arrays make
the code far more readable I'm not so sure its the most efficient method if
you are a speed junkie.

<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(4)=r&amp;  versus  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{PTSIN+8}=r&amp;

Just like <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a><a href="#()">()</a>, the line <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>(a)=b produces a BSR and some math
instructions. Here's two more examples using the old school method, before
Frank introduced the fancy built in arrays:

<a href="#'">'</a> example #3: alt long form
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> pcircle3(x&amp;,y&amp;,r&amp;)
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>}=11
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>+2}=3
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>+6}=0
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>+10}=4
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>}=x&amp;
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>+2}=y&amp;
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>+8}=r&amp;
  <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a>
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

<a href="#'">'</a> example #4: alternate short form
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> pcircle(x&amp;,y&amp;,r&amp;)
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>}=x&amp;
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>+2}=y&amp;
  <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>+8}=r&amp;
  <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> 11,0,3,4  !opcode
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

The interesting thing here is a study of the assembler output. I was expecting
to see some math, but instead the compiler does a cool optimization like so:

<a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>+8}=r&amp;  !becomes...

BSR      <a href="#PTSIN">PTSIN</a>          ;adr of ptsin array <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> d0
MOVEA.L  d0,a0          ;save <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> a0
MOVEA.L  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),a2  ;address of r&amp;
MOVE.W   (a2),d0        ;value of r&amp; <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> d0
MOVE.W   d0,8(a0)       ;stuff it in the ptsin array at offset 8!

This produces less code than the long form, but slightly more than the short
form.

I  fire up the TT030 in plain TOS. MiNT seems to cause inconsistent results,
perhaps something to do with task switching. Here's the results for all four
bindings using 1000 iterations:

example #1 <a href="#-">-</a> short form:     15.085
example #2 <a href="#-">-</a> long form:      15.075
example #3 <a href="#-">-</a> alt short form: 15.085
example #4 <a href="#-">-</a> alt long form:  15.075

From these results we can see that both versions of the short form end up
faster. There doesn't seem to be any advantage to the old school poking method.

You will also notice none of my examples set <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#.">.</a> This is because GFA's
startup code has already copied the value of <a href="#V~H">V~H</a> to <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#.">.</a> This scheme
relies on the fact that the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> won't alter <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#.">.</a> If you add a line like
<a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#V~H">V~H</a> you are wasting CPU cycles. ;o)

One last point to remember. Always use the built in graphics and <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> commands
if at all possible and only use a binding if you absolutely have to. User
routines use the stack for parameter passing whereas the built-in commands use
registers, which is faster.

<a href="#DEFTEXT">DEFTEXT</a> however is an exception to this rule. Internally it calls
vqt_attributes() regardless of the parameters, even if some are omitted. This
is done to keep track of the attributes used inside it's own fake windows,
which no one ever uses. If one is doing a lot of text colors and effects, the
internal call to vqt_attributes() is wasting cpu cycles. There's a new compiler
option ($D~) to speed up <a href="#DEFTEXT">DEFTEXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> This option removes the needless call to
vqt_attributes()<a href="#.">.</a>

Rev 5  3/12/2018

Another look at the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> <a href="#+">+</a> GFA, take two  :o)

Can anything else be done to get even more performance out of the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> <a href="#+">+</a> GFA?
Actually, the answer is yes. First some background information.

GFA actually has 2 sets of AES/VDI parameter blocks. The 1st set is for the
coder and custom bindings, aka INTIN/INTIN() and friends. The 2nd set is for
all built-in <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> commands. GFA does't normally give access to it's internal
parameter blocks. This scheme keeps the built in commands from clobbering the
user parameter block contents.

I discovered this a very long time ago and forgot to document it in my
GFABASIC.hyp:

  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +44 contrl     6 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +48 global    15 words  (shared, same as GB+4)
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +52 gintin    20 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +56 gintout   20 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +60 addrin    10 longs
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +64 addrout   10 longs
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +68 contrl    12 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +72 intin    128 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +76 ptsin    256 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +80 intout   128 words
  <a href="#GB">GB</a> +84 ptsout    30 words

Hidden on the end of the <a href="#GB">GB</a> structure is 10 extra pointers. These extra
pointers point to GFA's internal AES/VDI arrays! These have been there since v3
and perhaps even in v2, I have not looked. They are certainly valid for v3
regardless. I suppose the next question is, how is this relavent?  The answer
is simple, now you can snoop the results of all built-in AES/VDI calls.
Interesting, yes?

The other thing you need to keep in mind, the built in graphics commands are
hands down faster than any binding you can write, since the parameters are
register based. All most all of them are 100% clean <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> calls, especially the
DEFxxx commands and graphics primitives. A command like this <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> ,x' where
a parameter is omitted (line style) only generates code for that one parameter.
The compiler is very efficient in this regard.

Thus <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> ,1' compiles to a single call to vsl_width(1)

Typically if you need the result of some <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> call, you would be forced to write
a binding. Let's use the command vsl_width() as an example, it returns the
actual width that was set. In the past if you wanted to know the result, then
you ran in trouble.

<a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> ,x  !no return value of course

<a href="#'">'</a> so you do this
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> vsl_width(c&amp;)
  <a href="#INTIN">INTIN</a>(0)=c&amp;
  <a href="#VDISYS">VDISYS</a> 16,0,1
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> <a href="#PTSOUT">PTSOUT</a>(0)
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

This is all well and good, but now you can do this:

<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> vsl_width(c&amp;)
  <a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> ,c&amp;               !set only the width
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{<a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{<a href="#GB">GB</a>+84}}  !snoop GFA's internal <a href="#PTSOUT">PTSOUT</a>(0)
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

This will actually outperform the short <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> binding. I did some benchmarking
with Hatari, since aranym can't be trusted at all.

It's possible to push it even faster, if you don't mind using some global
variable:

ptsout_%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{<a href="#GB">GB</a>+84}     !initialize this somewhere in your app startup
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> vsl_width(c&amp;)
  <a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> ,c&amp;
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{ptsout_%}  !use the global instead
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

Using the global gains even a bit more speed.

If you need maximum speed just throw away the pretty vsl_width() wrapper and
use the code directly where needed. It will go even faster still. Remember user
coded subroutines use the stack for parameter passing, so the mere pushing of
the parameters slows it down.

Dealing with extra workstations is another potential area to improve
performance. A lot of people write bindings that pass the workstation handles.
Perhaps the manual was never clear on this, but GFA pre-loads <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6) with
the default handle for the workstation it opens at startup. It also keeps a
backup copy of this handle in case it gets lost. I assume the thought process
is this. I need to do some <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> calls on a different workstation, therefore I
must use a bunch of custom bindings. This is really not the case at all. GFA
has a handy way of sending all <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> calls to any open workstation, even custom
bindings so long as they don't touch <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#.">.</a>

A bit of pseudo code:

handle=@v_opnbm(<a href="#.">.</a>..   !offscreen buffer (especially a workstation)
<a href="#'">'</a> let's draw to it without using any custom bindings
<a href="#V~H">V~H</a>=handle      !send all vdi calls offscreen
<a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> 0,0,w&amp;,h&amp;  !vs_clip()

Not only is this much smaller compiled, but it's far quicker than a bunch of

It goes without saying, the speeds up here are small, but on slower hardware
every little bit adds up.

If you are using a binding for a built in command because you think it's broken
somehow, please do report it. Bugs must to be eradicated. Happy <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> coding. ;o)

by <a href="#Lonny_Pursell">Lonny Pursell</a>
Rev 3  3/12/2018
_________________________

GFA allows two types of functions. There's the classic single line functions
defined with <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> and the more advanced multi-line style. The single line
functions defined with <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> always output slower floating point values.
There's no option to change this behavior and thus my advice is to avoid <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a><a href="#.">.</a>
If you are using <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a>, then they should be recoded into multi-line functions.

The multi-line style functions are far more flexible and the return value can
be adjusted to output much faster integer values.

The <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> option must be entered as the first line of a function to have an
affect. It instructs the compiler to output the return value of the function as
an integer. The default output is a floating point value!

This default behavior is probably some throw back to the classic days of BASIC
where everything was floating point. Unless you care about it yourself at each
and every function, you will always get the slower floating point.

<a href="#$F%">$F%</a> does not specifically imply long type. The compiler actually checks the
variable at <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#RETURN_x">RETURN x</a>' and adjusts the code automatically based on the variable
type. In other words the compiler will auto cast it to the correct integer
type. String functions are handled automatically by the compiler and <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> is
ignored.

To be more precise, the <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#%">%</a>' (percent sign) means return any integer type, it
does not mean return only long type. The compiler does not report syntax errors
within compiler commands, it simply ignores them.

Not only does this speed up your functions but it reduces the code size of each
function. Option <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> eliminates two library calls, BSR FITOF (integer to float)
and BSR FFTOI (float to integer)<a href="#.">.</a> Both of these add several lines of needless
assembler overhead to each function call made!  Quite literally if <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> is
missing the function converts the output to floating point and then the
assignment to some variable converts it back. The effect of this at each call
of a function is, integer <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> float -&gt; integer, which is for sure not very
optimal.

Example code:

a%<a href="#=">=</a>@test                     !BSR FFTOI (flt to int)
<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a%
<a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>
<a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> test
  <a href="#$F%">$F%</a>                        !this absolutely has to be the very 1st line!
  <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> 1.23456789          !BSR FITOF (int to flt)
<a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

A space between <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$">$</a>' and 'F%' will cause it to fail. Example:

<a href="#$">$</a> F%  !compiler fails to see the option

According to some French manuals $F| and $F&amp; are valid options. These do not
work, in fact it will result in a float being returned!  I've also seen $F$ and
$F! in other peoples source listings and they do not work either.

To be precise, no where in the compiler source code is a check for $F!, $F!,
$F&amp;, or $F$<a href="#.">.</a> All of these produce slower floating point output. The compiler
has exactly one check for <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$F%">$F%</a>' only. Any books or manuals that state otherwise
are incorrect.

Here's a tip. GBE has a built in syntax check for all compiler commands. It
will find typos and misplaced compiler commands. GBE will even tell you if you
have placed <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> at the wrong line. To use this feature go to the 'Setup' drop
down menu and click 'Test $Options' so its check marked. Now, when you click
'Make', 'Run', or 'Test' it will report any incorrect compiler commands like
any other error and place the cursor at the offending line.

_______________________________________________________________________________

There is also two types of void. <a href="#VOID">VOID</a> and <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#~">~</a>' (tilde), however VOID first
converts the result to a float then throws it away. The short form is faster as
the result is always an integer.  Examples:

<a href="#~">~</a>@my_func      !faster
<a href="#VOID">VOID</a> @my_func  !slower

_______________________________________________________________________________

If your program is well tested and you are 100% sure all of your functions exit
with <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> var', then you can use option <a href="#$F&lt;">$F&lt;</a><a href="#.">.</a> This will further reduce the
code size, as it removes a test for missing <a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a> commands.

_________________________________

There are thee commands for calling subroutines written in assembler. Each
command has its pros and cons and you will have to decide which one fits your
needs. This chart may help:

Command   Saves a3-a6   Parameter size(s)  Returns a value
<a href="#C:">C:</a>()      Optional      Words/Longs        Yes
<a href="#CALL">CALL</a>      Optional      Longs              No
<a href="#RCALL">RCALL</a>     Always        Longs via array    Yes via array

The most critical thing involved with calling assembler is the contents of
registers a3-a6 since these are used internally by GFABASIC itself. Obviously
you don't want to mess up a7 either since that's the stack. By default compiled
code does not save and restore these registers, but that's easily changed with
the <a href="#$C+">$C+</a> compiler option.

In some cases you will be forced to use <a href="#$C+">$C+</a>, either because you didn't code the
assembler part yourself, or you don't have the skill to recode the assembler
listing. It's also possible you are calling a shared library that uses these
registers.

If a3-a6 are destroyed the symptoms can be just about anything. It might
freezing up, issue strange error messages that make no sense, or outright
crash. If you add the compiler option <a href="#$C+">$C+</a> and the problem(s) goes away, you
probably solved it.
_______________________________________________________________________________

So how do I use this <a href="#$C+">$C+</a> compiler command?  There's actually two forms of this
compiler option and they only work with <a href="#C:">C:</a>() and CALL:

<a href="#$C+">$C+</a> !turn on a3-a6 register saving
<a href="#$C-">$C-</a> !turn off a3-a6 register saving

If your assembler routine never touches a3-a6 you don't have to do anything. In
fact avoiding <a href="#$C+">$C+</a> will speed up the program. The default state of the compiler
is <a href="#$C-">$C-</a> (off)<a href="#.">.</a>

If you only have one assembler subroutine it's as simple as putting <a href="#$C+">$C+</a> at the
top of your listing since its treated like a global. Any use of <a href="#C:">C:</a>() or <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>
throughout the program will automatically save and restore a3-a6.

If by some chance you have two assembler subroutines and only one clobbers some
critical register then placing the compiler option before each call is probably
the best way.

<a href="#$C-">$C-</a>
result%=C:asm1%<a href="#()">()</a> !does not touch a3-a6
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#$C+">$C+</a> !option on
result%=C:asm2%<a href="#()">()</a> !clobbers some critical register
_______________________________________________________________________________

Other things to remember:

Parameters must be passed on the stack, thus if calling a 'C' function one must
use the <a href="#cdecl">cdecl</a> parameter passing method. By default parameters passed using <a href="#C:">C:</a>()
are treated as word size unless one uses the <a href="#L:">L:</a> function. Example:

result%=C:asm_adr%(1,2,L:3,L:buf_adr%)

In the interpreter registers a3-a6 are always saved and restored regardless of
which command is used.

Note: <a href="#CALL">CALL</a> is completely broken in the original interpreter, but fixed in the
updated one.

by <a href="#Lonny_Pursell">Lonny Pursell</a>
Rev 3  3/12/2018
_____________________________

What does compiler option $m actually do?  In short it limits the amount of ram
a compiled program will use. It causes a compiled program to allocate only what
it needs from the start.

How does $m differ from <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a><a href="#?">?</a>  A typical compiled program eats all available
ram minus 16384kb, then <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> can be used to free some of it.

Why does this matter? Firstly it should be stated that desk <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> must
never consume all available ram, so $m is required. If a desk <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> did eat
all ram, I assume the boot process is going to halt at some point. That would
be bad, plus desk <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> are suppose to co-exist along with other
applications. Another scenario where $m is very important is multitasking. A
single application consuming all available ran in a multitasking environment,
pretty much is a show stopper.

What's actually stored in this block of memory allocated with compiler option
$m? That is a very good question because none of the GFABASIC manuals clearly
state that. The following list should shed some light on that.

<a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> of all types, the array data and the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a>

Strings, the string data and the string <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a>

Examples: <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> list$(8),line%(16),char|(128)
          name$<a href="#=">=</a>"GFABASIC"

What's not stored in this block of memory? All other variables that are not
arrays or not strings. These are stored in the BSS section of the program.

Examples: version#=3.6
          size%=2048
          flag!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>
          mask|<a href="#=">=</a>&amp;HF

Note: <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> and <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> are stored in the DATA section of the program.

So how does one calculate the value for compiler option $m? Yet again another
good question. Even I have had trouble with this in the past and many times its
simply trial an error. The larger the program, the more arrays and the like,
the harder it becomes to calculate.

GFABASIC manages arrays and strings with something called a <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a>  I'm
not going to explain how these work, but know that they are exactly 6 bytes.
There are other bits of information used along with the <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a> This
information breaks down like so.

Bytes  Description
6      array or string <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>
       (for string arrays, each <a href="#index">index</a> has its own string <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>)
4*<a href="#?">?</a>    1st dimension (if more than one, 4 times the number of dimensions)
4      back-trailer
4      block size

Note: Strings are also stored on an even address. If the length of the string
is odd then a byte is wasted for alignment.

As you can see by the list above it could be rather tricky and/or time
consuming to calculate the exact ram required for each and every array in your
program! To make matters worse, strings and string arrays tend to be dynamic
and every one a different length, then add to that you might change them while
its running.

Since I just mentioned that strings are dynamic, we are going to take some time
to explain how GFABASIC manages this block of memory. It uses a classic
technique called garbage collection to manage the strings dynamically as they
change. When a string is reassigned its old contents is marked as unused, but
remains and a new section of the memory block is used. Eventually, after enough
string reassignments occur, the memory block fills up and quite literally
there's no more space left. This is when a garbage collection occurs. All the
strings marked unused are removed and the ones in use are shuffled around to
free up some space. This is why the address of a string might change! I suspect
this works like this for speed reasons, if a garbage collection occurred at
every string reassignment it would surely slow down the program. Error #8
occurs when the garbage collection fails to free up enough space for a new
string assignment or an array DIMension.

I have a coffee mug that says "I love computers! I can sit and watch them do my
work for hours!" What if GFABASIC could help determine the value of compiler
option $m? Who knows better exactly how much ram is being used at any given
moment? The answer of course is GFABASIC itself. This got me thinking and so
what I'm going to suggest is a way for your program, plus a few added lines of
code, can help assist you with this task.

I consider this method a debugging only situation and thus you never want to
leave this sort of code in a finished program. I suggest you copy your source
code to something like "test.gfa" or "debug.gfa" and leave it in the same
directory as the original, so the program can be tested and still find any
support files it might need. The editor handles memory differently and new
variables can be introduced on the fly, they cannot be stored in the BSS
section, thus this debugging method will require you to compile a copy of your
source code. When the debugging is done the copy can be deleted which is easier
than trying to remember which lines of code was added for debugging.

This is not going to involve any magic or peeking around in the libraries
hidden memory, no sir, we are going to use only commands provided by the
language. This method should work equally well with any library. The most
important one being the function <a href="#FRE">FRE</a><a href="#()">()</a> which is designed specifically to return
the free memory within the memory block we are discussing.

<a href="#FRE">FRE</a><a href="#()">()</a>    returns free memory without a garbage collection
         (includes unused strings)
<a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0)  forces a garbage collection, then returns the result
        (this is the important one)

<a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0) happens to be very accurate, however we want to know how much memory is
used by our arrays and strings, not how much memory is free for new ones. The
solution is to save the value of <a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0) right away at the start of the program
and subtract <a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0) from that value later. We are also going to use a simple
method to note the peak amount of ram used.

In order to monitor the amount of ram used in real-time we are going to use the
<a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> command to make a simple interrupt that calculates the ram used and
displays it on the screen somewhere. We are also going to use <a href="#ATEXT">ATEXT</a> to display
it, this way it doesn't disrupt the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> settings or <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> while the program is
running.

Here's an example listing:

<a href="#'">'</a> $M256000  !remove if not using malloc() or set it unusually high
<a href="#$I+">$I+</a>,U+      !required for the every command
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> if using <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> in a compiled program (hope not), it must be here
meminit__%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#FRE">FRE</a>(0)                  !must be first line of code
<a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> 200 <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> mem_check !200=1 second, adjust tick value if needed
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> your program would be here, for this example we do a little comparison test
it%=100 !iterations
<a href="#DIM">DIM</a> test$(it%)
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#CLS">CLS</a>                                        !assumes the console is open

<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

You can see by the example its fairly accurate in determining the peak amount
of ram used. For some reason it's always 6 bytes off. I'm not sure the
calculation I do for the comparison is correct. Its based on some <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>
documentation I found in a German hypertext. I don't think 6 bytes is going to
make or break the idea I'm trying to convey here.

Comment out any $m you may already have and let the program eat all available
ram for this test. If you are using <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a><a href="#()">()</a> then adjust $m to some unusually
large value, so your <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a><a href="#()">()</a>'s won't fail. Now add the lines in bold to a copy
of your source code and compile it. You might have to adjust the x/y position
of the <a href="#ATEXT">ATEXT</a> command for whatever resolution you are using. If for some reason
you can't display the value while the program is running, simply comment out
the <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> commands and dump the variable "___________" when the program ends.

I suggest putting the program through its paces, hammer on it, do whatever it
takes to produce the worst possible scenario that will consume the most ram.
It's the peak value you are trying to achieve. Lowering the tick value of the
<a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> command will slow the program down, but increase the accuracy of the
real-time monitoring.

Once you have this peak value, its only a matter of deciding how much extra to
add as a safety net, then you have your final value for $m. This method is also
not perfect, but it gives you a base value to begin with as opposed to guessing
entirely.  ;o)

This option control the way subroutines are compiled. The best way to explain
its use is via examples. Be prepared to see some assembler listings. ;o)

<a href="#$P&lt;">$P&lt;</a>   Optimize routines with no parameters and locals (compiler default state)
      Recursion might fail, also <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> and <a href="#RESUME_NEXT">RESUME NEXT</a> cannot be used.
<a href="#$P&gt;">$P&gt;</a>   Compile all routines as GFA routines

The original compiler manual is a little vague on these commands. It only has
an effect on subroutines without parameters and locals.

<a href="#Subroutines">Subroutines</a> with parameters or locals are always compiled as GFA subroutines,
meaning parameters, locals, and recursion is supported.

<a href="#Subroutines">Subroutines</a> without parameters and locals can be compiled into simple 68k
subroutines. This will speed up such subroutines, but recursion could cause
stack problems.

Typically the default state of the compiler is fine, so you don't have to do
anything. The only time you would have to use <a href="#$P&gt;">$P&gt;</a> would be if you have a
subroutine that's called recursively and it has no parameters and locals. In
the event that would be the case it's best to wrap the subroutine like so:

<a href="#$P&gt;">$P&gt;</a>                     !optimize off
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> get_dir_tree  !calls itself
  <a href="#'">'</a> blah
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>
<a href="#$P&lt;">$P&lt;</a>                     !optimize back on

Note: If the subroutine which is called recursively happens to have parameters
or locals then <a href="#$P&gt;">$P&gt;</a> is automatically applied.

Here's a GFA listing we will compile twice and dis-assemble as an example, so
we can see the actual difference:

<a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> no
<a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> yes(2)
<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> no       <a href="#!">!</a><a href="#proc">proc</a> with no parameters and locals

<a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> yes(x%)  <a href="#!">!</a><a href="#proc">proc</a> with a parameter
  <a href="#CLS">CLS</a>
<a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

As you can see in listing #2, procedure _NO contains more code and will be
slower. Procedure _YES is always compiled as a GFA subroutine since it has a
parameter.

<a href="#External_Arrays">External Arrays</a>
by <a href="#Lonny_Pursell">Lonny Pursell</a>
Rev 4  3/12/2018
________________________

Normally an array's memory resides inside GFA's variable memory area, as
defined by the compiler command <a href="#$M">$M</a><a href="#.">.</a> Have you ever wanted to point an array at
the screen buffer, or force an array to use a certain type of ram? The command
<a href="#ABSOLUTE">ABSOLUTE</a> does not accept arrays, but with this technique, you can get around
that.

For a lack of a better term I will refer to this type of an array as external.
This means the ram used by the array is outside of GFA's normal variable
memory area. The key to this technique is the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> which contains
a pointer to the ram used by the array.

This will also let you free the memory of an array or re-dimension it, without
it shifting other arrays in memory.

Here's an example using a 1 dimensional byte array:

<a href="#'">'</a> create an array as small as possible, so
<a href="#'">'</a> that it uses virtually no variable ram (<a href="#$M">$M</a>)
<a href="#'">'</a> this creates the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>,
<a href="#'">'</a> but it has only 1 element assuming option base 0
<a href="#DIM">DIM</a> test|(0)
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> allocate the ram needed for the array
<a href="#'">'</a> for each dimension add 4 extra bytes
<a href="#'">'</a> for option base 0 add 1 extra element
buffer%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a>(4+24+1)     <a href="#!">!</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> dim test|(24)
<a href="#IF">IF</a> buffer%=0
  <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "malloc() failed!"
  <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>
<a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> modify the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> to point
<a href="#'">'</a> at the newly allocated memory block
<a href="#'">'</a> and set it's dimension(s)
<a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{buffer%}=24            !set 1st dimension
<a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{*test|<a href="#()">()</a>}=buffer%      !redirect to the memory block
<a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> test|<a href="#()">()</a>,0         !we must clear it, ram will be dirty
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> test the array with some values
<a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i&amp;=0 TO 23
  test|(i&amp;)=i&amp;
<a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i&amp;
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> dump the values using the array
<a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i&amp;=0 TO 23
  <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> test|(i&amp;);" ";
<a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i&amp;
<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> dump the values directly from the memory block
<a href="#'">'</a> so we can see that the array has accessed it
<a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i&amp;=0 TO 23
  <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{buffer%+4+i&amp;}<a href="#;">;</a>" ";
<a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i&amp;
<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>
<a href="#'">'</a>
<a href="#'">'</a> free the array
<a href="#~">~</a><a href="#MFREE">MFREE</a>(buffer%)
<a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>

<a href="#'">'</a> example outputs:
<a href="#'">'</a> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
<a href="#'">'</a> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23


There are some rules if one uses this technique:

1) Never, ever use <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a><a href="#.">.</a> Internally GFA also stores a block-size and
back-trailer and these only come into play if one uses <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a><a href="#.">.</a> Since the ram for
the array is outside of GFA's normal variable memory area it will surely crash.
I say again, never, ever use <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a><a href="#!">!</a>

2) If you have some normal arrays and some external arrays, do not try to <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a>
a normal array either. This causes GFA to shift arrays in memory to fill the
empty gap. It will then likely crash if it tries to move an external array.
Again, do not use <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a><a href="#!">!</a>

3) To re-dimension an external array, simply modify the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> again.
Did I mention never, ever use <a href="#ERASE">ERASE</a><a href="#!">!</a> ;o)

4) Extreme care must be taken when setting the memory block size and
dimension(s)<a href="#.">.</a>

If you follow these 3 rules this technique works quite well. I've used it in my
own programs for quite sometime. This technique works interpreted or compiled.

Note: This technique works with any type of numerical array with any number of
dimensions, however it's untested with string arrays. String arrays are a
special animal in themselves and since each string in the array requires a
string <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> it's managed a bit differently. There's no way to force GFA
to move the actual string data to your memory block, it's hard coded to use
GFA's variable memory area. The list of string descriptors however will end up
(in theory) in the external memory block, thus I suspect this technique would
only relocate 6 bytes per element. Thus:

<a href="#DIM">DIM</a> t$(24) <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a>(4+((24+1)*6))  !assuming option base 0

I don't see much benefit in this, therefore I never bothered to test it.

With the release of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 one is provided with both an extensive
programming and powerful language which is easy to use via its quick and
friendly Editor. The entire framework and design of the language encourages
structured programming and provides the user with the necessary tools.

The Interpreter provides for simple debugging by means of the special commands
provided. <a href="#The_Editor">The Editor</a> supports structured programming by automatic indentation
of loops and conditions. Additionally, subroutines can be represented in the
program listing by name only, and 'opened' to their full length by pressing a
key.

In the area of conditional commands, various additions have been made to the
commands <a href="#IF">IF</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>-<a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>, which already existed in earlier versions of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>,
e.g. <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a>, <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#CASE">CASE</a>. Both the values of variables and the variables
themselves can be passed to procedures. Furthermore, the loop types <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>,
<a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>-<a href="#WEND">WEND</a>, and <a href="#DO">DO</a>-<a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a> available in earlier versions of
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> have been extended with <a href="#DO">DO</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, DO-<a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>, <a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a>-UNTIL, and
<a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

System level programming is achieved through the ability to call operating
system routines (<a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a>, <a href="#BIOS">BIOS</a>, <a href="#XBIOS">XBIOS</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> Many of these routines are also
available in the form of simple instructions. The programming of Interrupts
with <a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> and <a href="#AFTER">AFTER</a> is also possible. Assembler and C routines may be
interleaved into programs with instructions like <a href="#RCALL">RCALL</a>, <a href="#C:">C:</a>, <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>, and <a href="#MONITOR">MONITOR</a><a href="#.">.</a>
The most important <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> routines and all <a href="#AES">AES</a> functions, e.g. menu and form
management, are available as built-in functions.

<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> provides genuine Integer arithmetic, which offers high computing
speed, as well as floating-point arithmetic with high computational accuracy
(13 decimal places), while further variable types <a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>, <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>, and bit
operations <a href="#BCLR">BCLR</a><a href="#()">()</a>, <a href="#BSET">BSET</a>(), <a href="#BTST">BTST</a>(), <a href="#BCHG">BCHG</a>(), <a href="#SHL">SHL</a>(), <a href="#SHR">SHR</a>(), <a href="#ROL">ROL</a>(), <a href="#ROR">ROR</a>(), etc.,
have been included. Graphics programs can easily make use of the <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a>
routines which are implemented as instructions.

The next chapter describes the commands for the operation of the Editor. The
remaining chapters of the manual detail the instructions and facilities of
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0. These are arranged according to criteria concerning the
contents, with joint explanations of related terms, e.g. <a href="#MIN">MIN</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#MAX">MAX</a>(). In
the <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a> an alphabetical overview of the instructions and functions is
given, with references to the appropriate pages for full explanation.

Descriptions of Commands, etc. are laid out as follows:

     The syntax
     Description of the permissible parameter types
     Explanatory text
     Example

In the Syntax description optional parameters are indicated with square
brackets, e.g.

    <a href="#LEFT$">LEFT$</a>(a$[,x])

In <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> there are <a href="#Commands_and_Functions">Commands and Functions</a><a href="#.">.</a> Commands do not return a value,
e.g.

    <a href="#LINE">LINE</a> 100,100,200,200

Functions, on the other hand, do return a value and can display this value with
<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>, assign it to variables, etc. Here are some examples:

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("65")
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("a")
    a=<a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("a")
    b=<a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("a")+32

In this manual the fact that a Function returns a value is not noted in the
Syntax section, but is made clear in the explanation. In the Syntax section, in
the case of the function <a href="#ASC">ASC</a> for example, only ASC(a$) is specified and the
fact that this would be assigned to a numeric variable is not stated.

Where many optional parameters may be given, e.g. with the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statement, this
is shown by three periods:

    <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> x[,y,<a href="#.">.</a>..]

The description of permitted parameter types follows the Syntax section.  For
these types the following abbreviations are used:

<b><a href="#avar">avar</a>  Arithmetic variable</b>

This a numeric variable, which can be of any form, e.g. floating-point,
integer, boolean, etc.

<b><a href="#aexp">aexp</a>  Arithmetic expression</b>

This is any simple or complex expression which produces a number and can
include variables. Examples of arithmetic expressions are:

    a%
    3
    2+a%+<a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("a")

<b><a href="#svar">svar</a>  String variable</b>

This is a character string variable ending with <a href="#$">$</a>, e.g.<a href="#:">:</a>

    a$

<b><a href="#sexp">sexp</a>  String expression</b>

This expression can be of arbitrary complexity but must finally result in a
String. Examples of string expressions are:

    a$
    "Test"
    a$<a href="#+">+</a>"GFA BASIC"+<a href="#LEFT$">LEFT$</a>("MANUAL",4)

<b><a href="#ivar">ivar</a>  Integer variable</b>

This can be any integer variable.

<b><a href="#iexp">iexp</a>  Integer expression</b>

This is any simple or complex expression but the result must be an integer.

<b><a href="#bexp">bexp</a>  Boolean (logical) expression</b>

Any expression from which the result is a Boolean number.

It is important for some numerical expressions that particular variable types
must be used. The most important example of this is with memory addresses.
Addresses must be specified with at least a four byte variable and Boolean,
Byte, or Word variables are thus not allowed.

After the description of the parameter types comes the explanation of the
command. Here the meaning of the command and its individual parameters are
explained. The discussion of a command is terminated with one or more examples.
These examples are designed to be entered into the Editor and started with <a href="#RUN">RUN</a>
(shift+F10 or clicking <a href="#RUN">RUN</a> in the menu bar)<a href="#.">.</a> After each example the effect it
produces is given.

This form of command description is modified only in the section dealing with
the <a href="#AES">AES</a> library routines. Here the name of the appropriate command is given,
followed by the explanation of its function, then the syntax of the command
with the description of the individual parameters. At the end of the chapter
concerning the libraries several longer example programs are provided. The
reasoning behind this structure is that many commands in the chapter must be
used in correct conjunction with other commands, so that example programs tend
to contain many <a href="#AES">AES</a> calls and tend to be somewhat more extensive.

The manual concludes with a collection of tables and an alphabetical list of
all commands, with their page numbers.


<b>Note:</b> Where a program line is longer than the width of the page it has been
      wrapped round on the page and right justified. This will not happen
      when you are typing in the line, it will just extend to the right of
      the screen as far as necessary (up to 254 characters)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Memo:</b> The original manual claims a line can be up to 255 characters.
      That is incorrect.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Using_GFA-Basic_3_For_The_First_Time">Using GFA-Basic 3 For The First Time</h2>
This section is for those who have not used <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> before. Those who have
already worked with the older versions can just scan this section or, if
feeling very confident, jump to Chapter 2.

The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 Program disk is not copy-protected, so first make a back-up
copy of the orignal disk. You will find a description of how to do this in your
computer manual. Put the copy of the program disk in your disk drive and start
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> by clicking on the icon.

After a short while, the Editor screen will appear, which is where you can
write and debug your programs. For now, enter the following program lines,
pressing Return at the end of each line. Do not omit the spaces, which serve to
separate adjacent keywords. The indenting of instructions within loops is done
automatically by the Editor, as is the capitalisation (or lack of it) when
Return is pressed.

    <a href="#DEFFILL">DEFFILL</a> 1,2,8
    <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>
      <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=1
        <a href="#PBOX">PBOX</a> <a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a>,<a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a>,MOUSEX+30,MOUSEY+30
      <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>
    <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=2

In the upper right corner of the screen you will find the word 'Run'<a href="#.">.</a> Point
with the mouse arrow to this word and press the left mouse button to start the
program.

Now a white screen appears, on which the mouse pointer is visible. If you now
press the left mouse button and move the mouse about, you can draw on the
screen. A rectangle is used as a 'brush'. Pressing the right mouse button
termimates the program and a box appears containing the message 'Program end'<a href="#.">.</a>
Point to the word 'Return' in this box and press the left mouse button to
return you to the Editor.

How does this program work? Drawing takes place with the instruction in the
center of the program. It draws filled rectangles, with the four parameters
specifying the corner points. The first instruction of the program (<a href="#DEFFILL">DEFFILL</a>
1,2,8) determines what pattern the rectangle is to be filled with.

Information about the mouse is contained in the built-in variables <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>,
<a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a>, and <a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a> determines which mouse button is being pressed. MOUSEK=1 means that the
left button was pressed and <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=2 that the right button was pressed. <a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a>
and <a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a> return the x and y positions on the screen of the mouse arrow point.

The remaining commands (<a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>, <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>, <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>, <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>) are loop instructions. The
loop formed with the commands <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=1 and <a href="#WEND">WEND</a> means 'repeat, as long as
the left mouse button is pressed'<a href="#.">.</a> The outside loop, made from the instructions
<a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a> and <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=2, means 'repeat, until the right mouse button is
pressed'<a href="#.">.</a>

Since there are no further instructions after the <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, the program terminates
after leaving this loop. Move the cursor (with the arrow keys) to the beginning
of the line after the last and enter the following intentionally wrong program
line, in which the 'i' of the command word <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> is missing:

    prnt "test"

When you press the Return key to leave the line and confirm the instruction, a
bell sounds and on the second screen line the message 'Syntax error' appears.

<a href="#The_Editor">The Editor</a> checks during program entry whether the instructions entered are
syntactically correct. Now, with the cursor on the letter 'r', press the Delete
key three times. The program line should now contain only:

    p "test"

If the Return key is now pressed, then you can leave the line, as the letter p
is recognized automatically as an abbreviation for the command <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Editor">The Editor</h2>
<a name="Fundamentals"></a>The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Editor is no usual text editor, but was specially designed
for program development. Syntactically wrong instructions are recognised at the
typing-in stage. In addition, commands are indented automatically in loops or
conditional sections and command names expanded from their abbreviations, e.g.
p expands to <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a><a href="#.">.</a>

When writing a program a syntax check is carried out whenever the cursor leaves
the current line. If the line is not syntactically correct, then the message
'Syntax error' appears on the second line of the screen. It will only be
possible to move the cursor from the line by correcting the syntax or putting
an apostrophe at the beginning, thus converting it into a Comment.

Only one instruction per program line is allowed, but a comment may be added to
the end of a line by beginning the comment with an exclamation mark.

Program lines may he up to 255 characters long. When a line exceeds 80
characters in length it is scrolled horizontally to the left. When the cursor
leaves an instruction line a syntax check is done, correct indentation of the
line is carried out and the line is formatted. In addition, redundant spaces
are removed. e.g. '2 <a href="#+">+</a> 2' becomes '2+2', and the letters belonging to command
words and variable names are adjusted according to the current <a href="#DEFLIST">DEFLIST</a> setting.
The preset parameter <a href="#DEFLIST">DEFLIST</a> 0 causes all command words to he written in upper
case and all variable names in lower case.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Cursor_Keypad">The Cursor Keypad</h2>
Cursor control is by means of the block of arrow keys. The key settings are:
    Left arrow  <a href="#-">-</a> cursor moves one character to the left
    Right arrow <a href="#-">-</a> cursor moves one character to the right
    Up arrow    <a href="#-">-</a> cursor moves up one line
    Down arrow  <a href="#-">-</a> cursor moves down one line

The movements of the cursor are subject to certain restrictions. It can be
moved a maximum of one character beyond the last character in a line, and a
maximum of one line beyond the last line in a program. If the cursor enters a
line which is too short for the current cursor position, the cursor jumps to
the end of that line, otherwise it maintains its current column position (this
is different to the behaviour of the cursor in earlier versions of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>
It also is possible to position the cursor with the mouse. To do this point the
mouse arrow to the desired place and click the left mouse button.

The Insert key inserts a blank line between the line the cursor is on and the
line above. The cursor is set to the beginning of this blank line.

Clr/Home moves the cursor to the upper left corner under the menu bar.
Control-Clr/Home jumps to the beginning of the program listing.

The Undo key will cancel any changes made in an edited line, provided that the
changes have not been confirmed by moving the cursor off that line.

With the <a href="#Help">Help</a> key, procedures or functions in the program listing can be
shortened to just their name ('folded')<a href="#.">.</a> This is done by moving the cursor to
the line with the word <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> or <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> on it and then pressing <a href="#Help">Help</a><a href="#.">.</a> A
<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>' character is placed at the beginning of the line to indicate that folding
has occurred. The procedure or function can be unfolded in the same way, or by
deleting the <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>'<a href="#.">.</a> Of course this does not affect the procedure or function in
the program itself, only as listed. This folding up of subroutines enables one
to create short clear listings in which one 'opens' only the subroutine on
which one is working.

A program with folded up procedures can look as follows. Note, that to call a
procedure in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 only the procedure name is used.

    init
    main_menu
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> init
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> main_menu
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> menu_list
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> load
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> store

    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> show_info
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> test_info

With an opened procedure the program then appears as:

    init
    main_menu
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> init

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Numeric_Keypad">The Numeric Keypad</h2>
The numeric keypad is normally used to input numbers and some other characters.
However, in addition it can, in combination with the Control key, perform the
following functions:

Control and 4  Cursor one character to the left
Control and 6  Cursor one caharacter to the right
Control and 8  Cursor one line up
Control and 2  Cursor one line down
Control and 7  Jump to start of program (control-home)
Control and 1  Jump to end of program (control-z)
Control and 9  Move one page up (control-up)
Control and 3  Move one page down (control-down)
Control and 0  Equivalent to pressing Insert
Control and <a href="#.">.</a>  Equivalent to pressing Delete
Control and <a href="#-">-</a>  Toggle mode of numeric keypad
Control and (  Same as <a href="#-">-</a>

The functions are similar to those obtained on a PC when NumLock is not on.
The numeric pad can also be switched to a mode in which the keys can be used
without having to press Control as well. The switch is made by pressing Control
and <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#-">-</a>' on the numeric pad, and indicated by a circumflex to the left of the
menu bar. This key combination acts as a toggle switching between modes each
time it is pressed.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Modifier_Keys">The Modifier Keys</h2>
These keys only work in the editor and only for the following commands:

<a href="#DIR">DIR</a>, <a href="#FILES">FILES</a>, <a href="#DUMP">DUMP</a>, and <a href="#TRON">TRON</a>

Right-Shift  Pause display (halts scrolling when held down)
Caps Lock    Slow motion (slows scrolling when On)

<b>Memo:</b> This information was missing from the original manual.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Further_Editing_Commands">Further Editing Commands</h2>
The Delete key deletes the character at the cursor position, the remainder or
the line being pulled to the left.

The Backspace key deletes the character to the left of the cursor.

The Tab key moves the cursor eight character positions to the right.

Control+Tab moves the cursor eight character positions to the left.

LeftShift+Tab inserts blank spaces to the next tab position.

RightShift+Tab deletes all blank spaces in one row up to or from cursor.

The Return or Enter keys move the cursor to the beginning of the next line.

The Escape key enters Direct Mode, in which you can type in commands.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Further_Control_Commands">Further Control Commands</h2>
Control-Delete       Deletes the line on which the cursor appears
Control-U            Restores a line deleted as above, or below (the line may
                     be restored several times <a href="#-">-</a> like copying)
Control-Y            Deletes the line on which the cursor appears
Control-N            Inserts a blank line as with the Insert key
Control-Q            Call block menu (like function key F4)
Control-B            Mark beginning of block (Block start)
Control-K            Mark end of block (Block end)
Control-R            Page up
Control-C            Page down
Control-E            Replace text
Shift-Control-E      Input text and find/replace it
Control-F            Find text
Shift-Control-F      Input text and find it
Control-left arrow   Cursor jumps to the beginning of the line
Control-right arrow  Cursor jumps to the end of the line
Control-up arrow     Page up
Control-down arrow   Page down
Control-Clr/Home     Jump to beginning of the program
Control-P            Deletes everthing to the right of the cursor
Control-O            Brings back the string deleted with Control-P and inserts
                     it at the cursor position. Perhaps it is difficult to
                     remember these combinations; We thought of:
                       P <a href="#=">=</a> Put line end into buffer
                       O <a href="#=">=</a> Output line from buffer
Control-Z            Jump to the end of the program
Control-Tab          Cursor jumps one tab position to the left
Control-G (goto)     Move to Line Number display (top right on Menu bar), then
                     enter line number
Control-A            Enter <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code (up to 3 digits are accepted)
Control-S            Enter one character (bit #7 will be set)

A special group of Control commands makes the setting of 'Editor Marks'
possible. These marks are only meaningful to the Editor and have no effect on
the actual program. These marks can be set by Control-n, where n is a number on
the main keyboard. The cursor can be made to jump to a given mark by
simultaneously pressing Alternate and the appropriate number.

The key combinations of Alternate and the numbers 7-9 and 0 are preallocated.
They are as follows:

Alternate+7  Makes the cursor jump to the last cursor position before Direct
             mode or before a program was last Run.
Alternate+8  The cursor jumps to the line where the last error occured.
Alternate+9  Moves it to the position at which the last search procedure was
             started.
Alternate+0  Moves the cursor to the last cursor position at which a change
             was made.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Menu_Bar_and_Function_Keys">The Menu Bar and Function Keys</h2>
The items in the menu bar on the second and first screen lines are also
available via the function keys and Shift-function keys respectively.




On the far left of the menu bar is the Atari symbol (/\), clicking this
generates another menu containing the menu titles, Atari symbol and <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a>
Clicking the Atari symbol causes an Alert box to appear, giving the title and
version number of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.xx and the two options Editor and Menu. Clicking
the Editor button returns you to the Editor, or clicking Menu brings you back
to the same menu.







The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Menu Bar contains the following items:

<b>Save</b>

A File Select box appears, by means of which the current program can be stored
by entering a program name and clicking on OK.

<b>Load</b>

A program can be similarly loaded into the Editor by clicking on the program
name and then clicking on OK.

<b>Deflist</b>

Makes possible the adjustment of the appearance of the program listing (see
<a href="#DEFLIST">DEFLIST</a> later on for details, or experiment)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>New names</b>

By means of this item a mode can be set in which variable names are queried as
you introduce them into a program. This is useful as GFA-Baisc allows long
variable names, making typing errors possible. If you are editing a program and
do not mean to introduce new variables and you mis-type an existing name, this
feature will warn you.

<b>Editor</b>

Clicking this entry will return you to the editor.


On the right-hand side of the menu bar is a clock and the line number display.
The use of these two items is explained later on.

Under the Atari symbol there is a space for two further indicators, namely an
up-arrow character (&#8593;) to show when Caps Lock is active on the keyboard, and
the circumflex (<a href="#^">^</a>) showing when the numeric pad is used for cursor movements,
etc. These two modes can be entered and exited by clicking the mouse on the
space for the indicator (or the indicator itself if present)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Load (F1)</b>

The command load is used to load a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 program. This will be in
tokenised format, which enables programs to be loaded and saved quickly, using
less disk space. The extension <a href="#'">'</a>.GFA' will be looked for by default.

Earlier versions of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> saved their programs using a different
tokenisation process. For these programs to be loaded into version 3 they must
first be saved, using the old <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>, in <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> format ('Save,A') and then
loaded into Version 3 with Merge. After that they can be stored in version 3
format with Save, and then Loaded as normal.

<b>Save (Shift+F1)</b>

A File Select box appears, in which the desired program name can be specified.
The extension <a href="#'">'</a>.GFA' will be added to the file name if no other is given. If a
file of that name already exists on the disk it will be renamed to <a href="#'">'</a>.BAK'.

<a name="==&gt;"></a><b>Merge (F2)</b>

With this command a file in <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> format can be inserted into the current
program, starting at the line above the cursor position. The default file
extension will be <a href="#'">'</a>.LST'. Syntax checking is also carried out during the
Merging process, but instead of interrupting with a Syntax error when an
uninterpretable line is encountered, the line will be prefixed with the
characters <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#==&gt;">==&gt;</a>', and must be fixed before the program can be Run.

<b>Save,A (Shift+F2)</b>

The current program will be stored in <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> format. The extension <a href="#'">'</a>.LST' will
be added to the filename if no other is specified. If a file with that name
already exists on the disk, it will be renamed to <a href="#'">'</a>.BAK'.

<a name="."></a><a name=".dot_commands"></a><a name=".LL"></a><a name=".PL"></a><a name=".FF"></a><a name=".HE"></a><a name=".FO"></a><a name=".LR"></a><a name=".L-"></a><a name=".L+"></a><a name=".Nx"></a><a name=".N0"></a><a name=".PA"></a><a name=".P-"></a><a name=".P+"></a><a name=".IN"></a><b>Llist (F3)</b>

This command causes the program to be printed out in the manner specified by
so-called Dot Commands within the program. They have no effect other than on
the printout, and are as follows, where 'x' represents a digit:

    <a href="#.LL">.LL</a> xx        Maximum line length
    <a href="#.PL">.PL</a> xx        Maximum page length
    <a href="#.FF">.FF</a> xxx       Form feed character (for printers, which have other
                  values than &amp;H0C (Decimal 12)<a href="#.">.</a> (<a href="#.FF">.FF</a> 012 is the default)
    <a href="#.HE">.HE</a> head      Text to be put on the first line of each page
    <a href="#.FO">.FO</a> foot      Text to be put on the last line of each page
    <a href="#.LR">.LR</a> xx        Left margin
    <a href="#.L-">.L-</a>           Conditional printing: This instruction causes the following
                  lines not to be printed
    <a href="#.L+">.L+</a>           <a href="#Printing">Printing</a> starts again if it was stopped by a previous <a href="#.L-">.L-</a>

<b>Note:</b> To print the symbols \ and <a href="##">#</a>, use <a href="#\\">\\</a> and \# respectively.

<b>Memo:</b> The <a href="#.dot_commands">.dot commands</a> are not case sensitive.
      A space after the command is optional.
      Syntax errors are silently ignored.
      There are 22 commands in all.
      Comments are not supported in <a href="#.dot_commands">.dot commands</a><a href="#.">.</a>
        Example: <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#.HE">.HE</a> header <a href="#!">!</a> test' will output 'header ! test'

<b>Quit (Shift-F3)</b>

After querying this command to make sure you are sure, <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> is exited
completely and normally you will be returned to the Desktop.

<b>Block (F4)</b>

If no block has been marked, then the message 'Block <a href="#?">?</a>??' appears on the second
line in order to indicate that a block command would be unreasonable. If,
however, a block has been marked, then the Block menu appears on the top line
of the screen. Items can then be chosen with the mouse, or by pressing the key
corresponding to the first letter of the command (except for block Delete,
which for safety is called from the keyboard by Control-D)<a href="#.">.</a>




<b>Copy</b>

Copies the block to the current cursor position. The block remains marked.

<b>Move</b>

Moves the block to the current cursor position. The block is then 'forgotten'
and no further block commands can be used until another is marked out.

<b>Write</b>  Stores the block as an <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> file (to be read via Merge)

<b>Llist</b>  Prints the block out

<b>Start</b>  Moves the cursor to the beginning of the block

<b>End</b>    Moves the cursor to the end of the block

<b>Del</b>    Deletes the block (Control-D)

<b>Hide</b>   Removes the block markers

Clicking the mouse outside the Block menu or pressing a key removes it, and the
original menu is restored.

Note: The oddly placed clock symbol in the block menu seems to be a typo or
      minor bug in the editor. It doesn't do anything.


<b>New (Shift-F4)</b>

The program currently in the Editor is deleted.

<b>BlkEnd (F5)</b>

The line before the cursor is marked as the end of a block. If the start of
block marker is located before this line, the block is shown in a different
color (or with a dotted background if a monochrome monitor is being used)<a href="#.">.</a> The
end of a block can also be marked by means of Control-K, without recourse to
the Block menu.

<b>BikSta (Shift-F5)</b>

Marks the beginning of a block as above. Control-B from the keyboard has the
same effect.

<b>Find (F6)</b>

A string of text can be input, which then becomes the object of a search
starting from the current cursor postion. If the string is found, the search
can be continued for another occurrence of the string with Control-F or
Control-L. When a string is found, the cursor is put at its position, or, if
not, at the end of the program. If Find is called again, the previous search
string is presented, which may be accepted with Return, deleted with Escape, or
edited with the cursor, delete and backspace keys. The command can also be
called directly by Shift-Control-F or Shift-Control-L.

You can use the Find function to search in the header rows of closed procedures
or functions.

<b>Procedures which have been 'folded' (see above) are not searched.</b>

<b>Replace (Shift-F6)</b>

This command is for replacing one string of text by another. First the user is
asked for the text to be replaced, then the replacement text. If the text to be
replaced is found, the cursor moves to the beginning of that line. The actual
replacement can be effected with Control-E, where upon another search is made
for further occurrences of the string to be replaced. The command can also be
called from the keyboard using Shift-Control-E. The editing facilities for the
strings are available as above.

<b>Again, 'folded' procedures and functions are not searched.</b>

<b>Pg &#8595; (F7)</b>

Scrolls the screen one page down. Also called via Control-C.

<b>Pg &#8593; (Shift-F7)</b>

Scrolls the screen one page upwards. Also called via Control-R.

<b>Insert/Overwr (F8)</b>

Switches between insert and overwrite modes.

<b>Txt 16/Text 8 (Shift-F8)</b>

This feature is available only if a monochrome monitor is being used. It refers
to the size of characters displayed on the screen. 16-pixel high characters
(default) allow 23 lines to be displayed at once on the screen. Using 8-pixel
high characters, 48 lines are displayed.

<b>Flip (F9)</b>

This command switches between the Edit and Output screens. Pressing any key or
a mouse button also switches from the Output to the Edit screen.

<b>Direct (Shift-F9)</b>

Switches to Direct Mode, in which commands are responded to immediately, e.g.
<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "hello"<a href="#.">.</a> Some commands, e.g. loop commands, are not however available in
Direct Mode. This mode can also be reached by pressing the Escape key. In
addition, by use of the up and down arrow keys, the last eight commands entered
in Dircct Mode can be recalled, edited, entered, etc. The Undo key recalls the
last command. Direct Mode can only be entered when the syntax of the current
line in the Editor is correct.

Several lines of instructons can be executed from Direct Mode by writing them
as a procedure in Edit mode and then calling it from Direct Mode.

<b>Test (F10)</b>

Issuing this instruction causes all loops, subroutines and conditional
instructions to be checked for consistency without actually running the
program.

<b>Run (Shift-F10)</b>

The program currently in the Editor is started. If this program contains a
structural fault, of the kind that could have been found with Test above, then
an appropriate error message is displayed and the program is not started. A
running program can be interrupted by the 'Break key' combination,
Control-Shift-Alternate.

<b>The Line Number &amp; Clock Displays</b>

The Line number display and the Clock on the right of the menu bar both react
when clicked with the mouse. In the case of the clock, the cursor moves to the
first hour digit, and the time can be set by typing in the new time and ending
with Return. The input can be edited with the Cursor and Backspace keys, or
pressing Escape aborts the process, leaving the time display as it was.

With the Line number display, the cursor moves there, and a number can be typed
in. Pressing Return causes the cursor to jump to that line number. Instead of
clicking on the Line number display, Control-G could be typed to produce the
same effect. Only numbers are accepted as the input and they can be edited with
the Escape, Cursor and Backspace keys as before.

<b>Memo:</b> The Merge funtion will stop loading if <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> character 4 (Control-D)
      is encountered. If you must use this character in your program it's best
      to refer to it with <a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(4)<a href="#.">.</a> Merge cannot read Unix format <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> files.

<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 allows the following variable types:

<b>Type     Postfix  Memory requirements       Range</b>
Boolean  <a href="#!">!</a>        1 byte (1 bit in arrays)  0 or -1 (<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> or <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>)

Word     &amp;        2 bytes                   -32768 to 32767
Long     <a href="#%">%</a>        4 bytes                   -2147483648 to 2147483647
Float    <a href="##">#</a>        8 bytes                   2.225073858507E-308 to 3.595386269725E+308
String   <a href="#$">$</a>        0 to 32767 bytes          <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> value 0 to 255 for each character

<b>Boolean</b> (logical) variables can accept only the values 0 (<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>) or -1
(<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> If a non-zero value is assigned, then this value is taken as -1. This
variable type is designated by the postfix <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#!">!</a>', and occupies '1' byte of
memory. In boolean arrays elements require only one bit.

<b>Example:</b>

    b!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>
    c!=x&gt;y

<b>Byte</b> variables can accept values between 0 and 255. Larger values will
provoke a "Number not byte" error. The postfix for this variable type is the
vertical rule character <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#|">|</a>'<a href="#.">.</a> As the name implies, this variable type occupies
one byte.

<b>Example:</b>

    x|=128

<b>Word</b> variables are signed 2-byte integers. The postfix of this type is
<a href="#'">'</a>&amp;'<a href="#.">.</a> Numbers in the range from -32768 to 32767 can be represented. Outside
this range, a "Number not word" error occurs.

<b>Example:</b>

    x&amp;=32767

<b>Long</b> variables are signed 4-byte integers with the postfix <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#%">%</a>'<a href="#.">.</a> Numbers
can be represented in the range from -2147483648 to 2147483647.

<b>Example:</b>

    x%=2000000000

<b>Float</b> variables are signed 8-byte floating point with the postfix <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>'<a href="#.">.</a> The
range of representable numbers extends from 2.225073858507E-308 to
3.595386269725E+308. As this is the default type, no postfix is necessary. The
numerical accuracy is approximately 14 decimal places.

<b>Example:</b>

    x=123456789e123

<b>String</b> variables are designated by the postfix <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$">$</a>'<a href="#.">.</a> They can have a
maximum length of 32767 characters. Strings are administered by means of a
so-called <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>, six bytes in length. The first 4 bytes contain the
address of the character string, the last 2 bytes contain the length of the
string. If a string contains and odd number of characters a zero filler byte is
added. The address of the <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> (Backtrailer) is also added.

<b>Example:</b>

    a$<a href="#=">=</a>"qwertyuiop"

The address of all variable types can be determined with the help of the
functions <a href="#VARPTR">VARPTR</a><a href="#()">()</a> (<a href="#V:">V:</a>) and <a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a>() (<a href="#*">*</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Memo:</b> For more information on the internal storage of floats see page
      <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#GFA-Basic_v3_float_format">GFA-Basic v3 float format</a>'<a href="#.">.</a>

      There seems to be a difference between floats used in the Editor versus
      compiled. For example:
      f=2.5E+310
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> f
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#STR$">STR$</a>(f)
      <a href="#The_Editor">The Editor</a> produces the expected result "2.5E+310" while the
      compiled version produces a different result "2.499999997857E+310".

      The book <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Programmer's Reference Guide Volume I' (page 8)
      states a variable name can be up to 255 characters long.

      The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> v2.x manual (page 47) states this about variable names:
      Names of variables must begin with a letter and can be any length
      (limited, of course by the length of a line)<a href="#.">.</a> After the first letter in
      the name, digits, underscore, and period are allowed. The full name is
      always used to distinguish between variables.

      Function names appear to follow the same rules as variable names.
      Label names however do not follow the same rules. See <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a> for details.
      Procedure names appear to follow the same rules as labels.

      Notes on boolean!<a href="#()">()</a> arrays:
      These are not stored in the logical order as one might assume.
      Example:
          <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> b!(8)
          <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> b!<a href="#()">()</a>,<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>
          b!(0)<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>
          <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#BIN$">BIN$</a>(<a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{V:b!(0)},8) !results <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> "00000001"
          <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> b!<a href="#()">()</a>,<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>
          b!(7)<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>
          <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#BIN$">BIN$</a>(<a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{V:b!(0)},8) !results <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> "10000000"
      For speed reasons GFA stores them backwards. Thus accessing a boolean!<a href="#()">()</a>
      is not particularly useful unless this is the behaviour you expect.

      A signed byte is considered to be in the range of -128 to 127.

      The Motorola 68K series of processors use the <b>big-endian</b> format.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Arrays">Arrays</h2>

<a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a>

All variable types can be used in arrays, or 'fields'<a href="#.">.</a> An array can be
dimensioned with <a href="#DIM">DIM</a>, or the size of an array can be determined with <a href="#DIM?">DIM?</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The management of arrays in memory is effected by means of Descriptors. A
<a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> is a structure six bytes in length, the first four bytes of which
contain the address of the array. The next two bytes specify the number of
dimensions. The array field itself begins with sets of four bytes, giving the
number of elements in each dimension (beginning with the last dimension)
followed by the actual contents of the dimensions. With string arrays, instead
of the contents, the descriptors of the character strings follow the four
number-of-elements bytes. For example, after

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a%(2,3)

*a%<a href="#()">()</a> gives the address of the array <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a> The number of dimensions of
the array is in the last two bytes of the <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a>, therefore

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#DPEEK">DPEEK</a>(*a%<a href="#()">()</a>+4)

returns the value 2.

The array itself begins with the number of elements in the second dimension,
where the zeroth element is taken into account (assuming <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 is
valid), followed by the number of elements in the first dimension. Then

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#LPEEK">LPEEK</a>(V:a%(0,0)-8)

returns the value 4.

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#LPEEK">LPEEK</a>(V:a%(0,0)-4)

returns the value 3

Following this, the actual contents in the order:

a%(0,0), a%(1,0), a%(2,0), a%(0,1), a%(1,1), a%(2,1), etc.

With the instruction <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> numerical and character string arrays can be declared.
The structure of such an array was explained in the introduction of this
section.

An array with one dimension is only limited by memory. <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> b|(131072) would
use 128kb of ram.

Multi-dimensional arrays have two or more dimensions and follow different
rules. The possible number of the dimensions of the array is only limited by:

A) The dimensions must all be smaller than 65535
B) The product of the field elements must be smaller than 65535
C) The limit on the number of dimensions is 7

So <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a%(100,10,10) is permitted, as all the dimensions and the product
of the field elements (100*10*10=10000) are both less than 65535.

In an array, only variables of the same type may exist. The type of array takes
precedence over the type of number put into it.

The function <a href="#DIM?">DIM?</a><a href="#()">()</a> determines the total number of elements in an array.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x(10)
    x(4)=3
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> x(<a href="#LEN">LEN</a>("test"))
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#DIM?">DIM?</a>(x())
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> y%(2,3)
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#DIM?">DIM?</a>(y%<a href="#()">()</a>)

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Two arrays are declared. The output on the screen consists of the
    numbers 3, 11, and 12.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> should not be used within a <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a><a href="#.">.</a> It seems to clobber any
      <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> variables defined within the <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a><a href="#.">.</a> See <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#The_local=FN_bug">The local=FN bug</a>'
      notes from the GFA Basic FAQ by Bo Leuf.

      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> seems to crash the compiler if one attempts 8 dimensions:
      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a&amp;(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8) <a href="#&lt;">&lt;</a><a href="#-">-</a> causes the compiler to crash
      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a&amp;(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1) <a href="#&lt;">&lt;</a><a href="#-">-</a> runs ok in the editor!

      The limit of 65535 elements for multi-dimensional arrays doesn't work
      correctly:
      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x|(800,800)   !no error issued
      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x|(800,800,1) !error is issued

      How <a href="#DIM?">DIM?</a><a href="#()">()</a> works based on <a href="#OPTION">OPTION</a> BASE:
      <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0
      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> y%(2,3)<a href="#:">:</a> <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> 0-2,0-3 -&gt; 3*4=12

      <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> y%(2,3)<a href="#:">:</a> <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> 1-2,1-3 -&gt; 2*3=6
<hr size="3"><h2 id="OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</h2>
<b><a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> n</b>

n: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a> (must be 0 or 1)

With the help of the command <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> it can be decided whether an array is
to contain a zeroth element or not. With <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 (default) a zero-th
element is allocated, with <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1 it is not, and the array starts with
element number 1.

The contents of fields are not changed by the <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> instruction, however
the indices may be, as in the following:

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x%(3)
    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i%=3 <a href="#DOWNTO">DOWNTO</a> 0
      x%(i%)=i%
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> i%,x%(i%)
    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i%
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1
    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i%=3 <a href="#DOWNTO">DOWNTO</a> 0
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> i%,x%(i%)
    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i%

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> x%<a href="#()">()</a> is declared, by default including the zero-th element, and the
    elements are given the values 0-3 and printed. After <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1, there
    is no longer a zero-th element, and accessing the element 3 actually
    accesses what was element 2, etc.

The program ends with an error message on attempting to access the no longer
valid zero-th element of the array.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1 causes problems with compiled programs. The library
      contains a serious bug which renders <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1 unreliable. Stick to
      <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 and everthing is fine.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</h2>
<b><a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> x(),y</b>

x: name of an array (numerical variable type)
y: <a href="#aexp">aexp</a>

The instruction <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> sets all elements of the array x() equal to the value
of the numerical expression y.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x(10)
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> x(4)
    <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> x(),5+1
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> x(4)

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> The first number printed is zero, because when an array is dimensioned all
    elements are automatically set to zero. After filling the array with 5+1's,
    the number 6 is printed on the screen.

<b>Note:</b> It is not possibie to use the <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> command with string arrays.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#ARRAYFILL">ARRAYFILL</a> does not generate an error for undimensioned arrays in the
      editor or compiled.

The <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> command can only sensibly be used when <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 has been
activated. In this case, <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> 1 can be used to set the offset for the start
of the row and column indexing of one or two-dimensional fields with floating
point variables to 1 for the matrix operations. <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> 0 resets this offset
to 0 after a <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> 1.

The setting made with <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> n affects the following commands:

<b>Further <a href="#Special">Special</a> Cases</b>

As with <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> a(i,j)=b(k,l),w,h.

If <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> or <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a> are applied to vectors, j and l may be ignored.
Following a <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(n),b(m), a() and b() are interpreted as row vectors, i.e. as
matrix of the (1,n) or (1,m) types.

For a and b to be treated as column vectors, they must be dimensioned as matrix
of the (n,1) or (m,1) type, ie. <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(n,1),b(n,1).

If both vectors are of the same order (both are row or column vectors), <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a>
must be used. Irrespective of the type of vectors a and b, <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> always
treats both vectors syntactically as column vectors, so that the correct syntax
to be used for <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> is always:

    <a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> a(n,1)=b(m,1)<a href="#!">!</a>

For <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a>, one of the two vectors a and b must be explicitly dimensioned as
a row vector, the other as a column vector. For example:

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(1,10),b(5,1)

Since <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a> first transposes the second vector before copying it to the
first. For this reason, <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a> can only be used for <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(1,n),b(m,1)<a href="#:">:</a>

Optionally, the parameters h and w can also be used when copying vectors with
<a href="#MAT_CPY">MAT CPY</a> or <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a><a href="#.">.</a> However, the following applies: with <a href="#MAT">MAT</a> CPY, only the h
parameter is used for w=&gt;1. No copying takes place with w=0.

With <a href="#MAT_XCPY">MAT XCPY</a>, only h is used for w=&gt;1 if b is a column vector to be copied
into a row vector after transposition. No copying takes place when w=0. On the
other hand, only w is used for h=&gt;1 if b is a row vector which is to be copied
to a column vector after transposition. In this case, no copying takes place if
h=0.

<a href="#MAT_TRANS">MAT TRANS</a> a()=b() copies the transposed from matrix b to matrix a if a and b
are dimensioned accordingly, i.e. the number of rows from a must correspond to
the number of columns in b, and the number of columns from a to the number of
rows of n: for example, <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(n,m),b(m,n)<a href="#.">.</a>

columns, <a href="#MAT_TRANS">MAT TRANS</a> a() may be used. This command swaps the rows and columns of

<a href="#MAT_MUL">MAT MUL</a> a()=b()*c() is defined for matrix of an "appropriate" order.  <a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> b
and c are multiplied with each other. The result of this multiplication is
written to matrix a. In order for the result to be defined, the matrix on the
left (matrix b in this case) must have the same number of columns as the matrix
on the right (c in this case) has rows.  Array a, in this case, must have as
many rows as b and as many columns as c, for example:

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a(2,2),b(2,3),c(3,2)

<a href="#Arrays">Arrays</a> are multiplied as "row by column", i.e. element a(i,j) is obtained by

<a href="#MAT_DET">MAT DET</a> x=a([i,j])[,n] calculates the determinants of a square matrix of the
(n,n) type. The row and column offsets are preset to a(0,0) or a(1,1),
depending on <a href="#MAT_BASE">MAT BASE</a> 0 or <a href="#MAT">MAT</a> BASE 1, assuming that <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1 is enabled.
It is also possible, however, to calculate the determinant of a square part
matrix. To do this, the row and column offsets of a() must be specified as i
and j, and the number of elements in the part matrix as n. A part matrix of the
(n,n) type is then created internally starting from the "position" ith row, jth
column.

<a href="#ASC">ASC</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>() are complementary functions.

The function <a href="#ASC">ASC</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code of the first character in the subject
string. If the string is of zero length (""), zero is returned.

<a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a><a href="#()">()</a> gives a character, from a specified <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code. Only the lowest 8 bits
of x (the low-byte) are relevant, as <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> codes only go up to 255.

<a href="#STR$">STR$</a><a href="#()">()</a> produces a string (base 10) from the number 'x', with 'y' specifying the
required length.

A further variant of <a href="#STR$">STR$</a><a href="#()">()</a> is provided with the third parameter 'z'<a href="#.">.</a> The
number is formatted and rounded with 'y' characters and 'z' decimal places.

<a href="#BIN$">BIN$</a><a href="#()">()</a> converts an integer to Binary (base 2) representation. The optional

Binary, and Octal notation can be recognized.

The prefixes <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$">$</a>' and '<a href="#%">%</a>' may also be used to identify Hexadecimal and Binary

The individual CVx() functions have the following effects:

    <a href="#CVI">CVI</a><a href="#()">()</a>  Changes a 2-byte character string into an Word.

    <a href="#CVL">CVL</a><a href="#()">()</a>  Changes a 4-byte character string into a Long

With the functions xPEEK() one can read from specified memory locations.
With the functions xPOKE one can write to specified memory locations.

The individual variants are:

    <a href="#PEEK">PEEK</a>(x)   Reads a byte from the address x.
    <a href="#DPEEK">DPEEK</a>(x)  Reads two bytes (word) staring at address x.
    <a href="#LPEEK">LPEEK</a>(x)  Reads four bytes (long) staring at address x.

    <a href="#POKE">POKE</a> x,y    Writes the value y as a byte to the address x.
    <a href="#DPOKE">DPOKE</a> x,y   Writes the value y as a 2-byte word to the address x.
    <a href="#LPOKE">LPOKE</a> x,y   Writes the value y as a 4-byte long to the address x.

It is important that when using <a href="#DPEEK">DPEEK</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#LPEEK">LPEEK</a>(), only <u>even</u>
addresses are given.

The xPEEK() functions always work in <u>supervisor</u> mode.

xPOKE instructions have variants which work in the <u>supervisor</u> mode. So
protected addresses, e.g. 0 to 2047, can be modified. The appropriate
instructions are <a href="#SPOKE">SPOKE</a>, <a href="#SDPOKE">SDPOKE</a> and <a href="#SLPOKE">SLPOKE</a><a href="#.">.</a> Caution is advised, paricularly in
the <u>supervisor</u> mode, since modifications to protected addresses can have
serious consequences.

<b>Type      Meaning</b>
<a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>    Reads/writes a byte.

<a href="#CARD">CARD</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>    Reads/writes a 2-byte unsigned integer (0-65535)<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#WORD">WORD</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>    Reads/writes a 2-byte signed integer.
          Instead of <a href="#WORD">WORD</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> you may use <a href="#INT">INT</a>{} which has the same effect.

<a href="#LONG">LONG</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>    Reads/writes a 4-byte integer.
          Instead of <a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{x} you may use {x} which has the same effect.

<a href="#FLOAT">FLOAT</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>   Reads/writes an 8-byte variable in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 floating-point
          format.

<a href="#SINGLE">SINGLE</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>  Reads/writes a 4-byte floating-point variable in IEEE
          single-precision format.

<a href="#DOUBLE">DOUBLE</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>  Reads/writes an 8-byte floating-point variable in IEEE
          double-precision format.

<a href="#CHAR">CHAR</a><a href="#{}">{}</a>    Reads a string of bytes until a null byte (zero) is encountered, or
          writes the specified string of bytes and appends a null byte.
          Paricularly important for communication with C routines and <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a>

With x%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{adr%} the variable x% is assigned the long-word value found at the
address adr%, and with <a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{adr%}=x% the value of x% is written as a long-word
to the address adr%<a href="#.">.</a>

With <a href="#SINGLE">SINGLE</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> and <a href="#DOUBLE">DOUBLE</a>{} it is possible to read or write in IEEE format, used
by some 'C' compilers. So, with <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>, a number in the Single or Double
format can be converted and displayed in hexadecimal:

    a$<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#SPACE$">SPACE$</a>(4)

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#HEX$">HEX$</a>(<a href="#CVL">CVL</a>(a$),8)

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#HEX$">HEX$</a>(<a href="#LONG">LONG</a>{V:a$+4},8)

Some functions mentioned above approximately correspond: <a href="#LONG">LONG</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> for instance
corresponds to <a href="#LPEEK">LPEEK</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> However, <a href="#LONG">LONG</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> is quicker than LPEEK(), although it
will not work in the <u>Supervisor</u> mode. Attempting to access protected
memory locations (0 to 2047) with <a href="#LONG">LONG</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> will result in a bus error, with two
bombs displayed.

<a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a>(y)  *y</b>

x, y: variable name of any type

<a href="#VARPTR">VARPTR</a>(x) or V:x returns the address of variables or strings or particular
elements of arrays. <a href="#VARPTR">VARPTR</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#V:">V:</a> have the same effect.

<a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a>(y) or *y returns the addresses of variables, but for strings or arrays
the address of the <a href="#Descriptor">Descriptor</a> is returned. <a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#*">*</a> have the same effect.

*x (indirect array passing)

x: <a href="#svar">svar</a> or an array name followed by <a href="#()">()</a>

The multiply sign also serves as a pointer symbol. In this case *x gives the
address of the variable x in memory. With character strings *x$ gives the
address of the String <a href="#Descriptor">Descriptor</a> (as with <a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a>(x$))<a href="#.">.</a>

*x is synonymous with <a href="#ARRPTR">ARRPTR</a>(x)<a href="#.">.</a> This usage has special meaning with the
indirect passing of arrays and variables to subroutines. In addition one can
use, in Version 3, the instruction <a href="#VAR">VAR</a><a href="#.">.</a>

In its most simple variant the instruction <a href="#SWAP">SWAP</a> serves to exchange two

You can <a href="#xSORT">xSORT</a> string fields with an <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> only from version 3.02 on wards.
The <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> determines how many characters off the beginning shall not be
considered; e.g.

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> a$(256)
    <a href="#FILES">FILES</a> "<a href="#*">*</a><a href="#.">.</a>*" TO "LISTE"
    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "I",#1,"LISTE"

    <a href="#STORE">STORE</a> #1,a$<a href="#()">()</a>,x%
    <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #1

This program gives the directory as a file "LISTE", with <a href="#RECALL">RECALL</a> the array a$<a href="#()">()</a>
gets the contents, then the directory is sorted and STOREd to "<a href="#CON:">CON:</a>"<a href="#.">.</a> By giving
the <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> 13 it is not sorted by name but by the length of the files. " " and
"<a href="#*">*</a>" and "12345678.123" is skipped.

The instructions <a href="#SSORT">SSORT</a> and OSORT allow the elements of an array to be sorted
according to their size. <a href="#SSORT">SSORT</a> utilizes the Shellsort and OSORT the Ouicksort.
In the brackets of the array name a plus or minus sign may be inserted, meaning
that the sort is to be done in ascending or descending order respectively. If
neither is specified, the sort by default will be done in ascending order, as
with "<a href="#+">+</a>"<a href="#.">.</a>

The parameter "n" specifies that only the first "n" elements of the array are
to be sorted. If <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 is active (the default) these are the elements
from 0 to n-1; if <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 1 is active then elements from 1 to n are sorted.
If n=-1 then the whole array will be sorted.

When a further integer array is specified as the third parameter, that array
will be sorted along with the first array. Each exchange of elements in the
first array is also carried out in the second. This facility can be used, for
example, if one array contains a sort code, e.g. a post code, and another array
contains related information.

During the sorting of string arrays a sorting criterion can be specified in
form of an array with at least 256 elements by means of WITH. Without
indication of WITH the normal <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> order is used as a sorting criterion (see
second example)<a href="#.">.</a>

With the instruction <a href="#INSERT">INSERT</a> an array element can be inserted. With the

<a href="#INSERT">INSERT</a> inserts the value of the expression y in the array x() at the position
i. All elements of the array which have an <a href="#index">index</a> larger than i are shifted up
one position. Thus if an element stood at position 3 before, then it will be

is deleted.

<a href="#DELETE">DELETE</a> removes the i-th element of the array x()<a href="#.">.</a> All array elements which have

With <a href="#LET">LET</a>, values can be assigned to variables whose names are keywords.

By means of <a href="#LET">LET</a> one can transfer the value of an expression to a variable.  The

automatically when a keyword is used in this way and allows it.

<a href="#VOID">VOID</a> invokes a function but ignores the returned value.

Programming langnages normally differentiate between commands and functions.
Both cause some activity to be carried out, but with functions this activity
'returns' a value, which may be used as an element of an expression, displayed
with <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> or assigned to a variable etc.

Often, however, the programmer is not interested in the returned value, but
only in the activity carried out. For example, the function <a href="#INP">INP</a>(2) returns the
<a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code of a pressed key. If the program is only supposed to wait for a key,
any key, to be pressed, then the code of the key is irrelevant.

With <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>, in such a case <a href="#VOID">VOID</a> can be used to implement the function,
'forgetting' about the returned value. The alternative form (with a tilde '<a href="#~">~</a>'
instead of <a href="#VOID">VOID</a> calculates an integer value before forgetting it, making it
faster than <a href="#VOID">VOID</a>, which calculates a floating-point value.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#VOID">VOID</a> <a href="#INP">INP</a>(2)

or

<b>Note:</b> Memory can be reserved only in blocks of 256 bytes.

      <a href="#-">-</a>-----------------------------------------------------------------------

      The following known version problems exist with the function:

      <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> n
      Will often hang the interpreter in v3.5, probably because of fragmented
      variable space.

      <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> -n

      <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> (no parameter)
      Does not work at all in v3.6, i.e. we cannot restore the reserve state.

      The last fault is the most serious, since repeated running of a program
      which resizes the interpreter's memory will rather quickly crash due to
      memory shortage.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="INLINE">INLINE</h2>
<b><a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> addr,length</b>

addr: 4-byte integer variable, (not an array variable)
length: integer constant, less than 32700

This instruction reserves an area of memory within a program.

No comment is possible on the same line as this instruction, since memory is
internally reserved where otherwise the comment would be.

The reserved area always begins at an even address and it is initially filled
with zeros. When implementing <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> this address is written to the integer
variable addr. When the program is loaded or saved, the reserved memory area is
also.

Positioning the cursor on the program line which contains the <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a>
instruction and pressing the <a href="#Help">Help</a> key causes a menu line with the entries Load,
Save, Dump, and Clear to appear on the top line of the editor.




<b>Load</b> is used to load a machine code program or data into the reserved area.
<b>Save</b> saves the contents of the reserved area to disk.
<b>Dump</b> causes a hexadecimal printout on the printer of the reserved area.
<b>Clear</b> fills the reserved area with zeros.

If the <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> instruction is deleted, so also is the reserved area.

The default file extension is <a href="#'">'</a>.INL'.

In to this storage area, for instance, could be put pictures, tables or machine
code programs.

<b>Example:</b>

    See the example for <a href="#C:">C:</a> in the system routines section.

<b>Memo:</b> length&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{addr%-4} (this works in the interpreter only)
      The editor will not accept values over 32746, entering any value over
      this can cause strange behavior and/or a crash. Enter the value very
      carefully, once the editor issues the 'line to long' error message, it's
      too late!

      The editor will also accept -negative values and crash the moment you
      press the return key!

      The editor will aslo accept 0 as a size which does not appear to be
      fatal. However, one has to wonder what use this would have?

      Loading a file that is too large for the inline does not produce a
      warning of any kind. It will be truncated at the size of the inline.
      However it will complain 'end of file reached' if the file size is
      smaller than the inline size.

      It's not neccessary to strip the 28 byte header from assembler routines.
      The magic number $601A at the start of such a routine is actually a
      'bra.s start_addr+28' instruction. The header is effectively skipped,
      however removing the header will save you 28 bytes and one less
      instruction per call.

      When a program is compiled the INLINEs end up perfectly stacked one after
      another in the order they are encountered. Example: If you have 3 INLINEs
      exactly 10 bytes each, the 3rd <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> can be located by adding 20 to the
      address of the first <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a><a href="#.">.</a> In theory you could reserve 64000 bytes
      simply by defining 2 INLINEs 32000 bytes each one after the other.  This
      however is only valid when compiled.

x, y, z: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The function <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a><a href="#()">()</a> (<a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> 72) is used to reserve (allocate) areas of
memory.

If the parameter x is equal to -1, then the function returns the length of the
largest contiguous free area. If x is a positive number, then this means that x
bytes are to be reserved. In this case <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns the start address of
the reserved area. If a fault occurred with the reservation attempt, then the
value 0 is returned.

If larger areas are to be allocated, then first some of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>'s memory must
be freed with <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

Allocated storage areas must always be released before the end of the program,
although this is accomplished automatically when leaving the Interpreter.

<a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a><a href="#()">()</a> (<a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a> 74) will reduce the size of a storage area previously

storage area (which was returned by <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a><a href="#()">()</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> The second parameter z gives the
required (shrunk) size.

The function <a href="#MSHRINK">MSHRINK</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns 0 if the reduction was made without difficulty,
-40 if an incorrect address was given as y, or -67, if the new desired size was

Operators in a programming language serve to link and compare elements in
numeric and logical expressions.

In this chapter the operators available in GFA BASIC V3 are introduced in the
following five sections.

In the first section the numerical operators <a href="#+">+</a>, <a href="#-">-</a>, <a href="#*">*</a>, <a href="#/">/</a>, <a href="#^">^</a>, <a href="#DIV">DIV</a>, \, and <a href="#MOD">MOD</a> are
discussed. They link two numerical expressions and produce a number, which can
then be assigned to variables with the equals sign (<a href="#=">=</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> The operators <a href="#+">+</a> and <a href="#-">-</a>
have a secondary function as unary operators, giving a sign to a number (+1, -2
etc.).

The second section deals with the logical operators <a href="#AND">AND</a>, <a href="#OR">OR</a>, <a href="#XOR">XOR</a>, <a href="#NOT">NOT</a>, <a href="#IMP">IMP</a>, and
<a href="#EQV">EQV</a><a href="#.">.</a> They link two logical expressions and produce a logical result (<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> or
<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> The operator <a href="#NOT">NOT</a> has a special role in that it works on only one
logical expression and reverses its logical value (<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> becomes <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> and vice
versa)<a href="#.">.</a>

The third section deals with the concatenation (joining) of string expressions
using the plus sign (<a href="#+">+</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

The next section describes the comparison operators, which compare two
numerical or two string expressions and produce a logical result (<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> or
<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

The last section details the order in which operators are processed if several
occur in one expression, and the use of the bracket symbols ( and ), by means
of which the order of processing can be governed.

<a href="#^">^</a>
<a href="#DIV">DIV</a> \
<a href="#MOD">MOD</a>
+n -n</b>

n: number

These arithmetic operators link two numerical expressions and produce a number.
This number can then be used as part of another expression, assigned to a
variable, printed out with <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>, etc. The operators <a href="#+">+</a> and <a href="#-">-</a> are also used as
signs to indicate whether numbers are positive or negative (-1, +2, etc.).

x+y      Produces the sum of the numbers x and y (addition)

x-y      Produces the difference of the numbers x and y (subtraction)

x*y      Produces the product of the numbers x and y (multiplication)

x/y      Produces the quotient of x divided by y (division)

x^y      Produces x raised to the power y (exponentiation)

x <a href="#DIV">DIV</a> y  Results in a fast integer division of x by y

x\y      The backslash <a href="#'">'</a>\' character is an alternative form of <a href="#DIV">DIV</a>

x <a href="#MOD">MOD</a> y  Produces the remainder of the division of x by y.

<a href="#+">+</a> provides the value n with a positive sign, unless it was negative, in which
case it is left as it was.

<a href="#-">-</a> provides the value n with a negative sign. If is was positive, it is treated
as negative and vise versa.

See also <a href="#MOD()">MOD()</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The following relations are equivalent:

    x <a href="#DIV">DIV</a> y <a href="#=">=</a> <a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a>(x/y)
    x <a href="#MOD">MOD</a> y <a href="#=">=</a> x-y*<a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a>(x/y)

(<a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a><a href="#()">()</a> is the Truncate function.)

<b>Example:</b>

    13 <a href="#DIV">DIV</a> 4  produces 3
    13 <a href="#MOD">MOD</a> 4  produces 1

<b>Memo:</b> Additional reading related to the compiler, see sections

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Logical_Operators">Logical Operators</h2>

<a href="#NOT">NOT</a>, <a href="#IMP">IMP</a>, <a href="#EQV">EQV</a>

These logical operators work at the bit level for 32-bit integer values.
Logical operators link two logical expressions and produce a logical result
(<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> or <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> The operator <a href="#NOT">NOT</a> is an exception, in that it negates the value
of a given expression.

The numerical value for <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> is 0, and for <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> is -1.

For those interested in why these values should be chosen, the reason is that
<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> is considered to be all ones in a 32-bit integer, and <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> to be all
zeros. Thus:

    11111111111111111111111111111111 <a href="#=">=</a> <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>

and

    00000000000000000000000000000000 <a href="#=">=</a> <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>

Those familiar with two's complement arithmetic will recognize that the former
is the two's complement notation for -1.

All logical operators can also be applied to numerical expressions. In this
case the logical operations are implemented bit by bit. The effects of logical
operators will be described with so-called truth tables. In these tables the
logical values of the linked expressions are given in the first columns, and
the result in the last column.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="NOT">NOT</h2>
<b><a href="#NOT">NOT</a> x</b>

x: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The operator <a href="#NOT">NOT</a> negates a given logical expression. It is the only logical
operator, which has a single argument. Each individual bit of the argument is
modified.

These operators serve to compare the size of numerical and string expressions.
With numerical expressions the values are compared, and with string expressions
the comparison depends on the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> codes of the characters. The string "ABC"
is treated as the number sequence 65, 66,and 67.

In the comparison "ABC"<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>"AAA", the first characters are compared, which both
have the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code 65. Then the next character is compared. There "B" has a
higher code value than "A", and "B" is then taken as the 'larger'<a href="#.">.</a>

Here the comparison of the two strings is broken off, and the statement "ABC"
is larger than "AAA" is deemed logically <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

A special case of the comparison crops up if the two strings end before an
inequality is discovered. An example would be: "AA"<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>"A". This statement is
rated logically <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>, as is "A"<a href="#+">+</a><a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(0)<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>"A"<a href="#.">.</a>

Now to the individual operators:

    x&gt;y   <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> if x is greater than y.
    x&lt;y   <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> if x is less than y.
    x&gt;=y  <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> if x is greater than, or equal to y.
    x&lt;=y  <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> if x is less than, or equal to y.

The following are equivalent ways of writing the same expressions:

    x&lt;=y or x=&lt;y
    x&gt;=y or x=&gt;y

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "AAA"<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>"aaa"
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> -1&lt;=4-5

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> The numbers -1 and -1 are printed.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="&lt;&gt;">&lt;&gt;</h2>
<a name="&gt;&lt;"></a><b>x&lt;&gt;y</b>

x, y: exp

This operator checks whether two numerical or string expressions are unequal.
If this is the case, then the statement x&lt;&gt;y is logically <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a><a href="#.">.</a> If x and y are
the same, then the result of x&lt;&gt;y is logically <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The expressions x&lt;&gt;y and x&gt;&lt;y are equivalent.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "test"<a href="#&lt;&gt;">&lt;&gt;</a>"test"
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> -1&lt;&gt;4-5

x: var
y: exp

The equals sign <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#=">=</a>' can be used not only as a comparison operator, but also to
assign a value to a numeric or string variable. The value of the expression y
on the right of the equals sign is determined and assigned to the variable on
the left.

Numerical expressions can only be assigned to numerical variables, and
character string expressions can only be assigned to string variables.

Optionally, the command <a href="#LET">LET</a> may be used, which also permits the assignment of
values to variables which have the same names as keywords.

<b>Example:</b>

    x=<a href="#LEN">LEN</a>("TEST")+3

The function <a href="#ABS">ABS</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns the absolute value of a numerical expression. The
returned value is the same as the given value, except that its sign is ignored.
The sign of the returned value is always made positive.

With the function <a href="#SGN">SGN</a><a href="#()">()</a> one can determine the sign of a numerical expression
thus:

    <b>x           <a href="#SGN">SGN</a>(x)</b>

This function checks whether the numerical expression x is even. <a href="#EVEN">EVEN</a><a href="#()">()</a> results
in <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> for an even x and <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> for an odd x.  Zero (0) is treated as an even

This function checks whether the numerical expression x is odd. <a href="#ODD">ODD</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns
the value -1 (<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>), if x is odd and 0 (<a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>) if x is even. Zero (0) is

These functions allow independent manipulation of the parts of a numerical

<a href="#FIX">FIX</a><a href="#()">()</a> (<a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a>() and FIX() are identical) return a whole number.

The function <a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a><a href="#()">()</a> simply cuts off the digits to the right of the decimal
point.

<a href="#INT()">INT()</a> returns the largest whole number which is less than or equal to x. There
is no difference between <a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a><a href="#()">()</a> (or <a href="#FIX">FIX</a>()) and <a href="#INT()">INT()</a> for positive x-values,
however, with a negative, non-integer x a difference arises. So <a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a>(-1.2)
removes the decimal places and returns -1 as the result. <a href="#INT">INT</a>(-1.2), on the
other hand, returns the next smaller whole number, namely -2.

<a href="#FRAC">FRAC</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns only the fractional part of x, in other words just the decimal
places, with the same sign as x had. <a href="#FRAC">FRAC</a><a href="#()">()</a> is complementary to <a href="#TRUNC">TRUNC</a>() and

Divides an integer into the product of two other integers.

<a href="#SCALE">SCALE</a>(i,j,k) multiplies the integer numbers i and j, producing an integer
result. The result is then divided by the integer number k and the quotient is
returned. This is somewhat faster than i*j/k.

The return value is an integer so any decimal places will be lost.

integer with a maximum value of 65535 (&amp;HFFFF)<a href="#.">.</a> If y exceeds 65535, then its
low-order word is taken as the argument.

<a href="#RANDOM">RANDOM</a>(x) produces a random integer between 0 and x (including 0, excluding

required to have the same probability.

<a href="#RANDOMIZE">RANDOMIZE</a> y initialises the random number generator with the value y. If the
random number generator is initialised several times with the same y, the same
sequence of random numbers will be produced. Without the use of <a href="#RANDOMIZE">RANDOMIZE</a> at
the beginning of a program, different sequences will be generated each time the
program is run, which may be undesirable in some cases. For initialising the
random number generator one can also use <a href="#RANDOMIZE">RANDOMIZE</a> (without parameters) or
<a href="#RANDOMIZE">RANDOMIZE</a> 0, which initializes the random number generator with a random
number.

68000 instructions. Note, however, that they are used as functions, not
commands.

They reset, set, test, and negate individual bits. SHLx(), SHRx(), ROLx(), and
RORx() shift or rotate. <a href="#AND()">AND()</a>, <a href="#OR()">OR()</a>, <a href="#XOR()">XOR()</a>, <a href="#IMP()">IMP()</a>, and <a href="#EQV()">EQV()</a> are logical
functions. In the following explanations the convention is used that bit 0 is
the least significant bit. With 4-byte integers bit 31 is the most significant
bit and is also the sign bit (if the sign bit is set, i.e. =1, then a negative
number is represented in two's complement form, otherwise it is a positive
number)<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#SWAP()">SWAP()</a> exchanges the high- and low-order words of a 4-byte value. <a href="#BYTE()">BYTE()</a> reads
the lower 8 bits and <a href="#CARD()">CARD()</a> the lower 16 bits of an expression. <a href="#WORD()">WORD()</a> extends
a word to form a long word, i.e. bit 15 is copied into positions 16 to 31.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#BSET">BSET</a> (<a href="#BCLR">BCLR</a>) internally uses and returns a signed 32-bit value. If you

These functions permit the resetting, setting, negating, and testing of bits.
The bit numbers are counted starting from 0 on the 'right' and are internally
ANDed with 31, so that they are always taken as being between 0 and 31.

The function <a href="#BCLR">BCLR</a><a href="#()">()</a> sets the y-th bit of the numerical expression x to 0.

The function <a href="#BSET">BSET</a><a href="#()">()</a> sets the y-th bit of the numerical expression x to 1.

The function <a href="#BCHG">BCHG</a><a href="#()">()</a> sets bit y of numerical expression x to 1 if it was 0, or

<b>Note:</b> The bit representations have been grouped as two sets of 8 bits for
      the sake of clarity. <a href="#BIN$">BIN$</a><a href="#()">()</a> does not do this.

The next examples concern rotation. Here, bits which leave one end of the
argument are pushed in again at the other end. For instance, if only the
highest bit of a byte is set, and the byte is then shifted one bit to the left
(<a href="#ROL|">ROL|</a>(128,1)), the set bit which disappears off the left end is re-introduced
on the right as bit 0. With a shift to the left, (say <a href="#SHL|">SHL|</a>(128,1)) the set bit
would have been lost, with bit 0 being made zero.

Examples of rotation are:

    <b>x|     <a href="#ROL|">ROL|</a>(x|,1)   <a href="#BIN$">BIN$</a>(x|,1)   BIN$(<a href="#ROL&amp;">ROL&amp;</a>#124;(x|,1),8)</b>

    to a*2^b, if no bit is lost off the left end of the four-byte number a. The
    bit-shift formulation, however, is clearly quicker.

<a href="#IMP()">IMP()</a> resets a bit to zero if the appropriate bit in x is set and in y is

<b>Memo:</b> Internally GFABASIC uses a 4kb disk caching scheme. How does this work?
      All reads/writes are round to 4096 bytes. If you read one byte from a
      file, it will actually read 4096 bytes and any futher reads up to the
      end of the 4kb buffer will be read from ram. The same applies to writes,
      a 4kb buffer is created and it only purges the cache when its full. This
      speeds up disk reads and writes, especially with floppy disks.

      This disk caching scheme only applies to disk files. It is not used on
      devices like MIDI and serial ports, or the console even if one uses
      <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> on these devices.

      A warning about files <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> for output:
      You must make sure you <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> these files before your program exits or
      data could be lost. <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> will force any cached data to be written,
      before closing the file. If you let the operating system close these
      files at pterm(), any cached data will be lost and these files might be
      truncated.

<a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a> reads a character from the keyboard. This function will, however, not
detect depressions of the Shift, Alternate, or Control keys alone. <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a> does
not wait for a key to be pressed, but scans the keyboard to check whether a key
has been pressed since the last scan. If it has, the command accepts that
pressed key, otherwise a null string ("") is returned. When the key pressed has
no <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code, for example a Function key or the HELP or UNDO keys, then <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a>
returns the scan code of the pressed key as a two-character long string
containing <a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(0) as its first character, and the identification code of the
special key as the second character.

The following example demonstrates how the values returned by <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a> can be
examined:

<b>Note:</b> <a href="#CVI">CVI</a><a href="#()">()</a> turns a 2-byte string into an integer. As the first byte of the

<a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> ["text"<a href="#;">;</a>] x [,y,<a href="#.">.</a>..]</b>

x, y: <a href="#avar">avar</a> or <a href="#svar">svar</a>

The command <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> can be used in several ways. It accepts the input of
variables or variable lists with or without a text message being displayed on
the screen. For <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a>, the cursor will normally retain its last screen
position; however, by means of <a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a><a href="#()">()</a> followed by a semicolon, or by using
<a href="#LOCATE">LOCATE</a>, <a href="#VTAB">VTAB</a>, or <a href="#HTAB">HTAB</a>, the cursor can be put at a desired screen position.

A text string may follow the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> command, separated from the following
variables by a comma or a semicolon. If a semicolon is used, then a question
mark and a space are printed on the screen and the cursor placed at the
succeeding character position. When a comma is used, the question mark and
space are omitted, and the cursor is placed directly after the last character
of the text string.

If no text is to be displayed, then the question mark and space are printed,
and the cursor is put directly after the space (as if a null string ("") had
been used as text, followed by a semicolon)<a href="#.">.</a>

When only one variable is to be input, the user types in a number or a
character string and terminates it by pressing either the Return or the Enter
key. When several values are to be entered (if there was a list of variables
after the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> statement in the program line), each individual variable can be
terminated by pressing Return or Enter, or they may be typed in separated by
commas and all confirmed together with a single press of the Return or Enter
key.

If a string is to be entered which may contain commas, the instruction <a href="#LINE">LINE</a>
<a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> must be used.

If a numeric variable was expected by the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> statement, and a non-numeric
string typed in instead, a bell signal sounds, and the input must be repeated.

Prior to the Return or Enter key being pressed the input can be edited by means
of the Backspace, Delete, and Left and Right arrow keys. Pressing the <a href="#INSERT">INSERT</a>
key switches between, insert and overwrite modes during editing.  The maximum
length of the input is 255 characters.

<a href="#Special">Special</a> symbols can be entered in three different ways:

    <a href="#-">-</a> By holding down the Alternate key and typing in the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code of the
      desired character using the numeric pad. When the Alternate key is
      released, the appropriate character is displayed. For instance, with 64
      as the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code, the characeter <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#@">@</a>' appears. This also works with
      <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a>, <a href="#INP">INP</a>(2), GEM Dialog Boxes etc., if it is not switched off by the
      command <a href="#KEYPAD">KEYPAD</a><a href="#.">.</a>

    <a href="#-">-</a> By typing Control-S followed by another character, for example Control-S
      C for the Pi character. (Press the Control and S key at the same time,
      then press C.) This feature only works with the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> statement or in
      Edit mode, when a program is actually being typed in.

    <a href="#-">-</a> By typing Control-A followed by the <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code of the desired character,
      e.g.<a href="#:">:</a> Control-A 64 for the <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#@">@</a>' character.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> a$
    <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> "",b$
    <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> "Enter two numbers <a href="#:">:</a>";x,y
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a$,b$,x,y

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Reads in two strings and two numeric variables. The first input command
    generates a <a href="#?">?</a>, the second appears with no text and the third issues the
    message 'Enter two numbers: <a href="#?">?</a>'<a href="#.">.</a>

a$, b$<a href="#:">:</a> <a href="#svar">svar</a>

<a href="#LINE_INPUT">LINE INPUT</a> is a variant of the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> command. Unlike INPUT, it allows commas to
be accepted as part of the input. The preceding description of the input of
variables or a variable list, and the facilities for correction of the input
prior to the pressing of Return or Enter also apply to <a href="#LINE_INPUT">LINE INPUT</a><a href="#.">.</a> <a href="#LINE">LINE</a> <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a>,
however, may only be used with string variables.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#LINE_INPUT">LINE INPUT</a> a$

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a$,b$

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> When the program is Run, and the text 'com,ma' inputted twice, a$ is taken
    as 'com,ma' whilst b$ contains 'com', as the 'ma' is taken as a separate
    input and ignored. See also <a href="#LINE_INPUT_#">LINE INPUT #</a>.

<a href="#FORM_INPUT">FORM INPUT</a> and <a href="#FORM_INPUT_AS">FORM INPUT AS</a> are both used to input string variables. The value
of n specifies the number of characters to be entered, up to a maximum of 255.

Additionally, <a href="#FORM_INPUT_AS">FORM INPUT AS</a> displays the current value of a$, which can then be
edited, or taken as a 'default' input by pressing Return or Enter immediately.
The editing facilities are the same as those for the <a href="#INPUT">INPUT</a> command.

column, line: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The instruction <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>, without parameters, causes a blank line to be printed.
If the cursor happens to be on the last line, the entire screen is scrolled up
one line. <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> followed by an expression causes the expression to be printed
at the current cursor position. Text strings must be enclosed in quotes. If the
expression to be printed consists of several elements (constants, variables, or
expressions), the individual parts must separated by a semicolon, comma, or
apostrophe, with the following effects:

 A comma causes the cursor to move to one position past the next column number
  which is divisible by 16. In other words, the columns 1, 17, 33, etc. are
  used. If this takes the cursor beyond the end of the line, the cursor moves
  to column 1 of the next line.

 A semicolon causes the output of the corresponding elements, one after the
  other without any spaces being added.

 An apostrophe inserts one space between the appropriate elements.

<a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a><a href="#()">()</a> makes it possible for the expression to be displayed on a specified
line, starting at a specified column. Depending on the current screen
resolution, up to 80 columns and 25 lines are available.

<b>Note:</b> Column and line numbers begin at 1, and not 0.

If a window is open, the column and line numbers are relative to the top
left-hand corner of the window.

If the output expression (the message) is not terminated with a semicolon, the
cursor is placed at the beginning of the next line. If it was already at the
bottom of the screen, then the screen is scrolled up by one line.

If print control characters (<a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> characters from 0 to 31) are specified, then
these are processed by the <a href="#VT-52">VT-52</a> Emulator (see <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

The <a href="#WRITE">WRITE</a> command can be used to send output to the screen. The command is
followed by the numerical or string expressions to be sent, separated by
commas. The output <u>includes the commas</u> and, with string expressions,
the quotation marks are also included. A semicolon may be placed after the last
item to be output, in which case the usual Carriage Return/Line Feed will be
suppressed.

<a href="#LOCATE">LOCATE</a> places the cursor at the specified <u>column and line</u>, i.e. in the
<u>same</u> order as <a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> It will not, however, actually display

<a href="#PRINT_USING">PRINT USING</a> and its variant <a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a><a href="#()">()</a> USING serve to format data output on the
screen. These commands work in the same general way as <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> or <a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a><a href="#()">()</a>.
However, the data in the expression to be displayed are ormatted according to
the contents of format$<a href="#.">.</a>

The following symbols may be used to format a numerical expression:

    <a href="##">#</a>  Reserves a character position for a number (digit)<a href="#.">.</a>

    <a href="#.">.</a>  A period specifies the position of the decimal point within several <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>'
       symbols

    ,  A comma in the appropriate place between <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>' signs causes the insertion
       of a comma, e.g. as a 'thousands' separator in 10,000.

    <a href="#-">-</a>  The minus sign reserves a character position for a minus sign, in case
       the number to be printed is negative. For a positive number a space will
       be printed instead. (<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> normally prints nothing preceding a
       positive number.)

    <a href="#+">+</a>  Reserves a space for the plus sign of a positive number. If the number
       is positive, the <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#+">+</a>' sign will be printed, but if it is negative a minus
       sign will appear as usual. (See <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#-">-</a>' above.)

    <a href="#*">*</a>  Replacement for <a href="##">#</a> above, with the difference that leading zeros are
       replaced by asterisks, instead of blanks.

    <a href="#$">$</a>  Causes one dollar <a href="#'">'</a>$' character to be printed before a number, provided
       it is put directly before the first <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>' symbol.

    <a href="#^">^</a>  Specifies the length of the exponent (including the 'E+') when a number
       is to be printed in exponential format (e.g. E+123). If the number of
       digits before the decimal point is specified using several <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>' symbols,
       then the exponent is adjusted to take account of this.  For a negative
       exponent, the possibility of a <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#-">-</a>' must be allowed for by '-' above.

In contrast to <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Version 2, the principle 'Formatting First' is adhered
to. That is, in the case of overflows only the digits with character positions
reserved for them will be displayed. Thus, great care must be taken to ensure
that the string to be printed can actually be accommodated within the format
specified.

For formatting strings the following symbols are available:

    &amp;      Causes the output of the entire character string.

    <a href="#!">!</a>      The output is limited to the first character of the string.

    \<a href="#.">.</a>..\  Specifies the number of characters of the string to be printed.
           (The counting includes the two <a href="#'">'</a>\' symbols)<a href="#.">.</a>

    _      Causes the output of the character following the underline ('_')
           character. A sequence of characters can be output by placing it
           between two '_' characters.

<a href="#CRSLIN">CRSLIN</a> returns the current line (Y) position of the cursor.

<a href="#POS">POS</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns the number of characters displayed on the screen (ANDed with 255

<b><a href="#KEYPAD">KEYPAD</a> n</b>

n: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The numerical expression n is evaluated bit by bit and has the following
meaning:

    <b>Bit  Meaning             0               1</b>
    0    NumLock             On              Off

    5    <a href="#KEYDEF">KEYDEF</a> with ALT     Off             On

With bit 0 set the keypad will act as a 'PC' keypad with NumLock off, i.e. it
responds with cursor movements.

With bit 1 set the 'PC' NumLock mode can be toggled with Control and '<a href="#-">-</a>',
otherwise it cannot. Control and <a href="#'">'</a>(' also toggles NumLock mode. When NumLock
is on a circumflex (<a href="#^">^</a>) appears under the Atari logo in the Menu bar.

With bit 2 set, NumLock is effectively switched off while the Control key is
held down. Thus Control-4 (on the keypad) produces cursor movements.

With bit 3 set <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> values for characters can be typed in with the ALTernate
key held down. When ALT is released, the character appears.

With bit 4 set, the character strings assigned with <a href="#KEYDEF">KEYDEF</a> to the keys F1 to
F10 and Shift-F1 to Shift-F10 are output when the key is pressed.

With bit 5 set the ALTernate key must also be held down.

When turned on, the Atari ST is effectively configured to <a href="#KEYPAD">KEYPAD</a> 0. With
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> in operation, the default keypad mode is decimal 46, i.e.  bits 1, 2,

<a href="#KEYTEST">KEYTEST</a> is similar to <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a> and reads a character from the keyboard. If no key
was pressed since the last input (apart from Alternate, Control, Shift, and
Caps Lock) the returned value is zero, otherwise its value corresponds to the
key in the table shown below for <a href="#KEYGET">KEYGET</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#KEYGET">KEYGET</a> waits for a key to be pressed and then returns a long word value
corresponding to the key. This 32-bit long word is constructed as follows:

    Bits  0- 7: <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> code
    Bits  8-15: Zero
    Bits 16-23: <a href="#Scan">Scan</a> code
    Bits 24-31: Status of Shift, Control, Alternate, and CapsLock as follows:

    1    Left shift
    2    Control
    3    Alternate
    4    Caps lock

<a href="#KEYLOOK">KEYLOOK</a> allows a character to be read from the keyboard buffer, without
changing the buffers contents, as with <a href="#KEYGET">KEYGET</a> or <a href="#INKEY$">INKEY$</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The command <a href="#KEYDEF">KEYDEF</a> makes it possible to assign an arbitrary character string
(with a maximum length of 31 characters) to the Function Keys. The arithmetic
expression n (with a value from 1 to 20 inclusive) determines the key. A value
of n from 1 to 10 refers to the keys F1 to F10, and from 11 to 20, to the keys
Shift-F1 to Shift-F10. The defined string is available both during the running
of a program and from the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Editor.

However, in the Editor the ALTernate key must also be pressed, as otherwise the

    A key is then waited for.

Note: Using <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a> to detect the 'out of data' state is only useful if you have
      one set of <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statements. If you have more that one set of DATA
      statements used for different purposes, then <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a> cannot be used to
      detect the end of the first set.

<b>Memo:</b> If a string contains a comma or double quotes or spaces on either
      end, the entire string must be enclosed in double quotes.  Certain
      characters cannot be placed in <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statements.  They are <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> 4, 10,
      and 13.  Example: <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> "  spaces, "quotes", and commas in the string  "

      Adding quotes does not increase the size of the compiled binary.

      The <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a> pointer truely is a pointer, as it actually returns the address
      of the item in the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statement itself.  Thus, this can be done in the
      Editor:

      <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> test,this
      <a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{<a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>}<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#ASC">ASC</a>("T")
      <a href="#READ">READ</a> t$
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> t$

      The word "Test" will appear.
      This will actually change your source code if executed in the Editor!

      When compiled, the commas between data items become nulls which would
      allow the use of <a href="#CHAR">CHAR</a><a href="#{}">{}</a> to fetch data items.  Thus, this can be done in a
      compiled program:

      <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> Hello world,hi
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#CHAR">CHAR</a>{<a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>}

      The words "Hello world" will appear.

      <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a> seems to work in the interpreter, but I had problems with it in
      compiled programs. I think this is why:

        <a href="#RESTORE">RESTORE</a> test
        <a href="#READ">READ</a> a$
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a$<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>  !interpreter prints 'bug 0' (fails compiled!)
        <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>
        test:
        <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> "bug"

      The editor issues error #72 for <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>=x if these problems happen:
        <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>=x and there are no <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statements at all in the listing
        <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>=x and x is below the first <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statment
        <a href="#_DATA">_DATA</a>=x and x is above the last <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> statement
      However, it appears as 'Undefined error #72'<a href="#.">.</a> It seems Frank forgot to
      include some human readable text for this error code.
      The compiler issues no error and will even allow one to set it to zero.

      If the label used with <a href="#RESTORE">RESTORE</a> is undefined, the compiler will not issue
      an error message. Instead the data pointer will be set incorrectly to
      the first data statement in the program.

      Version 2 would issue an error reading strings with unpaired quotes.
      This was changed in version 3 and error code #36 was retired.
      Example____  v2___  v3___
      <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> "test"  test   test

In the following section, instructions related to file organisation are
explained.

First, however, it is important to know the structure of a file specification
and the rules of the hierarchical filing system. A file specification consists
of three parts: the drive specification, the file name and the filename
extension. The drive specification contains the disk drive identification in
the range A to P, followed by a colon. The file name is up to 8 characters in
length, with, optionally, an extension comprising a period and up to 3
characters. Groups of files may be gathered into directories (also called
folders), which may themselves be gathered into different sub-directories (or
folders) and so on. The lowest level of grouping (which contains all the files
on the disk in their respective directories and sub-directories) is known as
the root directory. Starting from this root directory, directories may be
accessed, followed by sub-directories, etc. Therefore, for a file to be
accessed, the following information must be given:

    <a href="#-">-</a> Drive specification
    <a href="#-">-</a> Name of directory if any, sub-directory if any, etc.
    <a href="#-">-</a> The actual name of the file and its extension, if any

These parts are separated by reverse diagonal strokes "\" (backslashes)<a href="#.">.</a> Names
for directories have the same format as filenames. The access path for a file
is a combination of these elements.

<b>Example:</b>

    A:\<a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>.DOC\MANUAL\CHAPTER1.DOC

This means that the file to be accessed, named CHAPTER1, has the extension .DOC
and is in a sub-directory called MANUAL, which it self is in a sub-directory
called <a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>.DOC. TEXT.DOC is in the root directory of disk drive A:.

Two special symbols are available to make file selection easier, which can be
used within file names and their extensions. These are the question mark (<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#?">?</a>')
and the asterisk (<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#*">*</a>')<a href="#.">.</a> The question mark acts like a 'wildcard' and will be
accepted as any character whose <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> value is greater than 32. The asterisk is
similar, except that it can be taken as any sequence of characters in the file
specification.

The command <a href="#DIR">DIR</a> will be explained in a moment, but for now, from the Direct
Mode of GFA BASIC (reached by pressing ESCape), you can type in <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DIR">DIR</a>', which
will cause all the files on drive A: to be displayed.

Typing <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DIR">DIR</a> <a href="#*">*</a>.GFA' lists those files which have the extension '.GFA'.

Typing <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DIR">DIR</a> ?AB?<a href="#.">.</a>*A' lists those files which have four-letter file names with
the middle two letters 'AB', and an extension ending in 'A'<a href="#.">.</a>

Typing <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DIR">DIR</a> <a href="#*">*</a><a href="#.">.</a>*' lists all files.

<a href="#DFREE">DFREE</a><a href="#()">()</a> (disk free) returns the amount of space free for storage on drive n in
bytes. This can take a few seconds, or longer with a partitioned hard disk
drive. See <a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> below for the meaning of the parameter n.

<a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> (Change Drive) sets the default disk drive. This is the drive which is
used by <a href="#DIR">DIR</a> etc. if no other drive is specified. Any drive can be made the
default drive with <a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> followed by the drive number from 0 to 16. Drive 0
corresponds to the current default drive, drive 1 corresponds to A:, drive 2 to
B:, etc. The argument of <a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> may also be a string, in which case the first
character (from A to P) identifies the drive.

<a href="#DIR$">DIR$</a>(n) returns as a string the current access path for drive n, as set with
<a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> below. See <a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> above for the meaning of the parameter n.

<a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> sets the current directory. Since the default drive cannot be changed
with <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a>, the specified directory must be on the current default drive or a
specified drive.

So, after <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "B:\TEST", the directory TEST on drive B: becomes the current
directory, which may be accessed without the need to specify the path
'B:\TEST'<a href="#.">.</a> With <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "\", one can return to the root directory from any
sub-directory. The directory required is always looked for as a sub-directory
of the current directory. Thus if, after making B:TEST the current directory as
above, one issued the command <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "TEST2", the effective path from the root
directory would be B:\TEST\TEST2.

There are two special folder names: <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#.">.</a>' aud '..', which are shorthand ways of
referring to the 'current' directory path and the 'parent' directory path
respectively. The parent path is that which leads up to, but does not include,
the current directory. For instance, with the path 'B:\TEST\TEST2' above, the
parent path is 'B:\TEST'<a href="#.">.</a> Thus to change the current directory to another on
the same level, perhaps TEST2A, it is only necessary to type <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "<a href="#.">.</a>.\TEST2A".

<b>Examples:</b>

    <a href="#CHDRIVE">CHDRIVE</a> 1

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Disk drive A: is selected as the current default drive, and its free
    storage capacity is printed. Then the current access path for drive B:  is
    printed, and finally drive <a href="#C:">C:</a> is made the current default drive.

    <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "\"
    <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "<a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>.DOC\MANUAL"
    <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "APPENDIX"

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#CHDIR">CHDIR</a> "\" sets the current directory to be the root directory of the
    current drive. In the second line MANUAL, which is a sub-directory of the
    sub-directory <a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>.DOC, is made the current directory. In the third line a
    further sub-directory APPENDIX is made the current directory, so that the

      <a href="#EXIST">EXIST</a><a href="#()">()</a> seems to cause a system crash if you attempt to change the
      resolution after it has been called at least once in a program. The
      <a href="#EXIST">EXIST</a><a href="#()">()</a> function ruins the command line. Either fetch the command line
      before using <a href="#EXIST">EXIST</a><a href="#()">()</a> or don't use EXIST(), instead call <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a>()
      directly.  Commands such as <a href="#FILES">FILES</a>, <a href="#DIR">DIR</a>, and <a href="#FILESELECT">FILESELECT</a> also clobber the

      Does not work well with long file names. Use fattrib() instead.

<a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> opens a data channel to a file or to a peripheral device. The expression
mode$ sets one of the following access modes:

<b>mode$              Description</b>
O  output          A file is opened to receive data. If neccessary the file
                   will be created, or, if the file already exists its contents
                   will be deleted.

I  input           A file is opened for reading.

A  append          An existing file is opened, and the data pointer set to the
                   end of the file. Data output to the file will then be added
                   at that point.

U  update          An existing file is opened for reading and writing.

R  random access   A <a href="#Random_Access">Random Access</a> file is opened for reading and writing.
                   This file type is described fully later.

The numerical expression n contains the channel number and can take a value
from 0 to 99. This channel number must be specified when working with the file.
The <a href="#'">'</a><a href="##">#</a>' sign before the channel number can be omitted, as the Editor will
supply it anyway. The expression name$ contains the access path and the file
name of the required file.

Instead of a file name, a peripheral device can be specified. The numerical
expression len is only used with the <a href="#Random_Access">Random Access</a> mode and defines the length
of a data record. The maximum record length is 32767 bytes, and the maximum
number of fields approximately 5000.

The following device names can be used:

      This line starts GFA-BASIC and the program TEST.GFA. Any output via

      IMPORTANT: Control-C will cause termination of the program if pressed
      while reading/writing file DUMMY. The default for input/output is the
      keyboard/console.

      Only the first character of the mode$ parameter matters. The length is
      not checked at all.

      Device numbers <a href="#=">=</a>&gt;6 are not supported by the <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> command.

With <a href="#BSAVE">BSAVE</a> an area of memory can be stored on disk (or RAM-disk, hard disk
drive etc.), and loaded again e.g. with <a href="#BLOAD">BLOAD</a>. The numerical expression addr
specifies the address of the first byte of the area to be saved, or, with
<a href="#BLOAD">BLOAD</a>, the address where the data from disk is to be put. If no address is
specified with <a href="#BLOAD">BLOAD</a>, the address that was specified with <a href="#BSAVE">BSAVE</a> when the area
was saved will be used. <a href="#BSAVE">BSAVE</a> must also specify the number of bytes to be
saved. The parameter name$ is the file specification of the file to which the
area is to be saved, or from which it is to be loaded. See the beginning of
"<a href="#File_Management">File Management</a>" for details of the specification. <a href="#BSAVE">BSAVE</a> and <a href="#BLOAD">BLOAD</a> always use

The commands <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> and <a href="#RELSEEK">RELSEEK</a> permit the re-positioning of the data pointer
with an accessed file, allowing the realisation of indexed sequential file
access. The numerical expression n contains the channel number used when the
file was OPENed. Both commands can be used only with files, not with peripheral
devices. The data pointer specifies which byte of a file was read or written
last. Except for access mode 'A' (used to append data to the end of an existing
file) the data pointer has the value 0 when opening a file. Reading or writing
commences with first byte, to which the data pointer subsequently points.

The <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> command positions the data pointer to a specified byte number in a
file. The pointer can, however be moved a specified number of bytes forwards or
backwards with <a href="#RELSEEK">RELSEEK</a> (relative seek)<a href="#:">:</a> the pointer is moved the number of
bytes specified in num. <a href="#RELSEEK">RELSEEK</a> is generally faster than <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a>.

<a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> may use positive values of pos up to the relevant file length. <a href="#RELSEEK">RELSEEK</a>
accepts positive or negative values of num, an error occurring when an attempt

<a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a>

<a href="#RECORD_#">RECORD #</a>

In the following section the handling of a <a href="#Random_Access">Random Access</a> file is described.
Two terms are particularly important: Data record and data field. A data field
is a single item of information, for instance a name or telephone number. A
data record consists of a number of data fields, and is analogous to one card
in a card <a href="#index">index</a><a href="#.">.</a> The length of a record (in bytes) must equal the sum of the
lengths of the individual fields.

The difference between a random access file and a sequential file lies in the
method of data access. With a sequential file the entire file must be loaded in
order to be able to access a particular data record, whereas with a random
access file the record may be obtained directly. This is particularly useful
with very large files, although this advantage is offset by greater consumption
of space on the disk, because a random access file uses a fixed record length,
resulting in waste if some records are shorter than others.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> and related commands when compiled, in most cases issue the
      wrong error code. If you see error #111, it's really some other error.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="FIELD">FIELD</h2>

<a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> #n,num AT(x) [,num AT(x),num AT(x),<a href="#.">.</a>..]</b>

n, num, x: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>
<a href="#svar">svar</a>$<a href="#:">:</a> svar (not an array variable)

The command <a href="#FIELD_#">FIELD #</a> AS is used to divide data records into fields. The
numerical expression n is the number of the data channel (0 to 99) of a file
previously opened with <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a><a href="#.">.</a> The integer expression num determines the field
length. The variable <a href="#svar">svar</a><a href="#$">$</a> contains data for one field of a data record.  If
the data record is to be divided into several fields, the parts 'num AS <a href="#svar">svar</a><a href="#$">$</a>'
must be separated by commas. The sum of the individual field lengths must equal
the data reeord length, otherwise an appropriate error message is displayed.
Thus in order to keep the field lengths to those specified in the <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> command
it is convenient to use the commands <a href="#LSET">LSET</a> and <a href="#RSET">RSET</a> or <a href="#MID$">MID$</a><a href="#.">.</a>

By using AT() instead of AS numeric variables can be written to a random access
file. In this case num must contain the length of the variable (1 for
byte-type, 2 for word-type etc.) and the brackets must contain a pointer to the
variable (see <a href="#*">*</a>, <a href="#VARPTR">VARPTR</a><a href="#()">()</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> Actually an arbitrary area of memory can be
transferred by specifying the number of bytes (num) and the address of the
first byte (x)<a href="#.">.</a> Note that there is no space after the 'AT'.

For example:

    <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> #1,4 AT(*a%),2 AT(*b&amp;),8 AT(*c#)

Arbitrary combinations of AS and AT() are possible, e.g.<a href="#:">:</a>

    <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> #2,4 AS a$,2 AT(*b&amp;),8 AT(*c#),6 AS d$

Unlike in Version 2, several successive <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> commands can be used, on
sucessive lines, referring to the same channel number. The effect is the same
as that of one long <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> command. The maximum record length is 32767 bytes,
and the maximum number of fields approximately 5000.

<b>Memo:</b> Version 1 had a limit of 9 fields.
      Version 2 had a limit of 19 fields.
      Version 3 has no such limit.
      Thus error code #53 was retired.

      Versions 1 &amp; 2 had a limit of one <a href="#FIELD">FIELD</a> command per <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> command.

between 1 and the number of data records in the file, specifying the number of
the data record to be read or stored. If r is omitted, the next record will be

The Atari ST is provided with two interfaces (ports) for the attachment of
mouse and joysticks. Port 0 can return mouse or joystick information, but port
1 can only return joystick data.

<a href="#STICK">STICK</a> 0 causes port 0 to return mouse information, and STICK 1 causes it to
return joystick information. Port 1 always reads a joystick. Normally it is not
necessary to use the command <a href="#STICK">STICK</a>, since mouse queries (<a href="#MOUSE">MOUSE</a>, <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>, etc.)
and joystick queries (<a href="#STICK">STICK</a><a href="#()">()</a>, etc.) cause STICK 0 and STICK 1 to be executed
automatically. However, before using <a href="#AES">AES</a> functions (<a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a>, etc.) the mouse
should be activated if necessary with <a href="#STICK">STICK</a> 0.

<b>Note:</b> A program that uses <a href="#STICK">STICK</a> 1 must also use STICK 0 before it exits!

The function <a href="#STICK">STICK</a>(p) returns the position of a joystick. For p=0 the joystick
at port 0 is read, and for p=1, the joystick at port 1. The values returned
correspond to the position of the stick as follows:













The function <a href="#STRIG">STRIG</a>(p) returns the state of the fire button on the joystick
attached to port p as a logical value: <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> (-1) if it is pressed, or <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a> (0)
if not.

<b>Note:</b> The values for 'p' on the STE can be in the range 0 to 5. 0 and 1
      act the same as normally found on the ST but 2-5 are exclusively for the
      STE, and <a href="#DO">DO</a> <a href="#NOT">NOT</a> check for the mouse at the same time. This effectively
      speeds up the joystick polling.

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> With movement of the joystick, appropriate messages are printed until the
    fire button is pressed. After waiting for it to be released, the program
    ends.

Note the difference between the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a> and <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> constructs:

    <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> condition

With <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>, the program segment will certainly be executed at least once,
whereas with <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> the program segment might not be executed at all if the
condition is false.

type <a href="#WAVE">WAVE</a> 1 to change the first parameter, leaving the others the same.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Chapter__7_-_Program_Structure">Chapter  7 - Program Structure</h2>
In this chapter the commands used for controlling the execution of a program
are discussed, starting with <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#Decision_Commands">Decision Commands</a>', by means of which the
execution of certain program sections is carried out only if certain criteria
are met. In the case of <a href="#IF">IF</a>, <a href="#THEN">THEN</a>, <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>, <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>, and <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a>, the criterion is a
logical one: BASIC checks if a logical expression is true or false, in addition
to these are the multiple decision commands <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a>, <a href="#CASE">CASE</a>, <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>, <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>,
and <a href="#CONT">CONT</a><a href="#.">.</a> These not only check for true or false, but can accept arbitrary
values which can be reacted to selectively.

The next section covers the loop commands, which make the repeated execution of
specified sections of a program possible. <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 is provided with a very
large number of such loop types: <a href="#FOR">FOR</a>-TO-<a href="#STEP">STEP</a>-<a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>, <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>-<a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, <a href="#DO">DO</a>-<a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a> or
ENDLOOP, <a href="#DO">DO</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>, DO-<a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, LOOP-WHILE, LOOP-UNTIL, and <a href="#EXIT_IF">EXIT IF</a><a href="#.">.</a>

For structured programming the use of sub-routines is of great importance.
With the commands <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a>, <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> (or <a href="#@">@</a>), and <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> (or <a href="#ENDSUB">ENDSUB</a>) new
'commands' can be created in the form of subroutines.

Functions may also be defined by the user. With the commands <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> and <a href="#FN">FN</a>
functions are created like formulas. More flexibility is possible with the
commands <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a>, <a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>, and <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>, which allow the formation of complete
subroutines that return a value.

Also in this section is a detailed description of the way in which variables
are dealt with by subroutines. Local variables may be declared with <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a>, with
the effect that they are only valid in that subroutine.  Variables of the same
name in other parts of the program are unaffected.  Variables can be passed to
subroutines as values, or, with the <a href="#VAR">VAR</a> command, the variable itself can be
passed (called by reference), and its value changed without the need to refer
to it directy by name in the subroutine.

The section on conditional branches also explains the commands which deal with
the following two special events: the simultaneous pressing of the 'break keys'
Control-Shift-Alternate, which normally stop a program; and the error situation
which occurs when, for example, an attempt is made to divide by zero, or to
take the square root of a negative number etc. Both of these events can be made
to trigger the execution of a user-defined routine, instead of stopping the
program.

It is possible in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 to call a subroutine when a specified amount of
time has elapsed, using the commands <a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> and <a href="#AFTER">AFTER</a><a href="#.">.</a> This is explained in this
chapter.

Towards the end of the chapter the absolute branch <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a>, the commands <a href="#PAUSE">PAUSE</a> and
<a href="#DELAY">DELAY</a>, which temporarily suspend program execution, as well as different
methods of ending the program (<a href="#QUIT">QUIT</a>, <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>, <a href="#END">END</a>, <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>, <a href="#NEW">NEW</a>, and <a href="#STOP">STOP</a>) are
presented. The last section covers the commands for monitoring the execution of
a program (<a href="#TRON">TRON</a>, <a href="#TROFF">TROFF</a>, <a href="#TRON_proc">TRON proc</a>, <a href="#TRACE$">TRACE$</a>, <a href="#DUMP">DUMP</a>, <a href="#ERR$">ERR$</a><a href="#()">()</a>, and <a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

  (instructions)
<a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a></b>

condition: <a href="#bexp">bexp</a>

These commands enable one to specify that a section of a program will only be
executed if a logical condition is met. The following example demonstrates
this:

    <a href="#IF">IF</a> a=1 <a href="#THEN">THEN</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "a is equal to 1"
      b=2
    <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

In this case a=1 is the logical condition. The instructions in the lines
between <a href="#IF">IF</a> and <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a> are processed <b>only</b> if this logical condition is
met.  If it is untrue, then the program continues with the commands after the
<a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a> and the command <a href="#THEN">THEN</a> is not considered. It should be noted that it is
sufficient to use the form:

    <a href="#IF">IF</a> a=1   instead of   IF a=1 <a href="#THEN">THEN</a>

The following construction is somewhat more complex:

    <a href="#IF">IF</a> a=1
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "a is equal to 1"
    <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "a is not equal to 1,"
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "it is equal to ";a
    <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

In this case shown above, the instructions between <a href="#IF">IF</a> and <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a> are processed if
the logical condition after the <a href="#IF">IF</a> is true. The program then continues
execution after the <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a><a href="#.">.</a> However, if the condition after <a href="#IF">IF</a> is not fulfilled,
then the instructions between <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a> and <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a> become effective. Again, program
execution is continued after the <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Note:</b> Any numerical expression, which is not equal to 0, i.e. is <a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>, is
      considered to be true. The logical value for <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> is -1 but any non-zero
      value is considered to be equivalent.

<b>Example:</b>

    x=1
    <a href="#IF">IF</a> x
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is true"
    <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

    <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "y is an even number"
    <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> First the message 'x is true' is displayed and then a numeric input is
    requested. Since x cannot be 9, the text appears 'y is an odd number', if

condition: <a href="#bexp">bexp</a>

The command <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> enables nested <a href="#IF">IF</a>'s to be more clearly expressed in a
program. The following examples show a simple menu selection made on a single
key-press. If l, s, or e is pressed then, respectively, a load, save or, input
routine is called. In all other cases the message 'unknown command' is printed.
The normal nested version is as follows:

    <a href="#DO">DO</a>
      t$<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(<a href="#INP">INP</a>(2))
      <a href="#'">'</a>

The use of <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> produces a shorter listing with smaller program indents:

The program works in the following way:

If the condition after <a href="#IF">IF</a> is fulfilled (t$<a href="#=">=</a>"l"), then the instructions between
<a href="#IF">IF</a> and the next <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> are processed <a href="#-">-</a> <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "Load text" - and then the
program jumps to the command <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a><a href="#.">.</a> If the condition for the first <a href="#IF">IF</a> is not
true then the other <a href="#IF">IF</a>'s are encountered.

In the second case, if the condition after the <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> command is met, then all
instructions up to the next <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a>, <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> or <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a> (if no ELSE exists) are

condition after the <a href="#IF">IF</a> or the condition after <a href="#ELSE_IF">ELSE IF</a> is true, then the
commands between <a href="#ELSE">ELSE</a> and <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a> are implemented (if an ELSE exists)<a href="#.">.</a>

This command branches the program to a procedure, which is in the list
specified after <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a><a href="#.">.</a> The x is a numerical (normally integer) expression,
whose decimal part (if any) is ignored. If x is smaller than 1 or larger than
the number of the procedure names after the <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a>, then no subroutine is
called. After calling the subroutine the program execution is continued
immediately after the ON x <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a><a href="#.">.</a> With this command no parameters can be passed
to the procedure.

<b>Example:</b>

    x=3
    ON x <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> proc1,proc2,proc3
    x=1
    ON x+1 <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> proc1,proc2,proc3,proc4

The command <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> makes branching possible using the <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> command, on the
basis of the value of the numerical expression x. The following examples give
an explanation of the program structure that results:

    x=0
    <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> x+2
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 1
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 1"
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 2 TO 4
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 2, 3, or 4"
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 5,6
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 5 or 6"
    <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is not equal to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6"
    <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> The message 'x is equal to 2, 3, or 4' is displayed.

First the numerical expression after <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> is evaluated, which is the branch
condition, in this case 2. Then the various <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> instructions are gone through
and checked as to whether the current value of the branch condition is to be
found.

In this example the argument '1' follows the first <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> command. Since the
branch condition is 2, the program jumps to the next <a href="#CASE">CASE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

After the second <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> are the arguments '2 TO 4'<a href="#.">.</a> As the value of x falls
within this range the condition is fulfilled and the message printed on the
screen. After that, program execution continues after the command <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>.
After the third <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> command is a further variant of the possible arguments for
the <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> command. There the desired values are separated, in a list, by
commas.

If none of the current branch criterion after the various <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> commands is met,
then the instructions between <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> and <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a> are executed (assuming a
<a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> is present)<a href="#.">.</a> In addition, instead of DEFAULT, <a href="#OTHERWISE">OTHERWISE</a> can be used
(giving compatibility with other BASICs) but the GFA interpreter replaces it
with <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> automatically.

Also, after <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> commands, not only numeric values but also strings may be used
as the argument. These may have a maximum length of four characters. If only
one character is specified then its <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> value is used as the branch
criterion. If two characters are specified, then this value is calculated as
follows:

    <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> value of first character <a href="#+">+</a> 255 <a href="#*">*</a> ASCII value the second character.

    <a href="#.">.</a>..and so on for the third and fourth characters.

<b>Note:</b> The maximum length of <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> is 4 characters, i.e. CASE "ABCD".

<b>Example:</b>

    exit!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#FALSE">FALSE</a>
    <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>
      key%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#INP">INP</a>(2)
      <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> key%
      <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "a" TO "z"
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "the lower-case letter "<a href="#+">+</a><a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(key%)+" was entered"
      <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "A" TO "Z"
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "the upper-case letter "<a href="#+">+</a><a href="#CHR$">CHR$</a>(key%) +" was entered"
      <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 27
        exit!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a> !program ends when &lt;Esc&gt; key is pressed
      <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "an inadmissible key was pressed!"
      <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>
    <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> exit!

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Within a loop the keyboard is queried and the program jumps according to
    which key was pressed and the appropriate message is displayed. Pressing
    the Esc key is used as an abort criterion for the loop.

The next example illustrates the meaning of the <a href="#CONT">CONT</a> command, which is
effective if it comes before a <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> or <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> command. This <a href="#CONT">CONT</a> command must
not be confused with the command of the same name used for resuming execution
of an interrupted program run.

<b>Example:</b>

    x=1
    <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> x
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 1
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 1"
      <a href="#CONT">CONT</a>
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 2
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 2"
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 1,3
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is equal to 3"
    <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x is not equal to 1, 2, or 3"
    <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Displays 'x is equal to 1' and then 'x is equal to 2'<a href="#.">.</a>

The <a href="#CONT">CONT</a> command provides a method of jumping over a <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> or <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> command.
In this example the value x is equal to the argument after the first <a href="#CASE">CASE</a>, i.e.
x=1. Therefore the message "x is equal to 1" is printed. Then comes the <a href="#CONT">CONT</a>
command, which jumps over the line <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> 2 and, although the branch condition is
not fulfilled, the <a href="#CONT">CONT</a> command causes the instruction <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "x being equal to
2" to be implemented. The normal processing continues with processing jumping
to the <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a> command.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> <a href="#INP">INP</a>(2)
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "a" TO "g"
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "a to g"
    <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "default"
    <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> If you press one of the a, b, c, d, e, f, or g keys the text 'a to g' is
    displayed, with any other key (except the shift keys) the message 'default'
    is printed.

With the <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> command a number of different possibilities can be combined, it
is not necessary for them to be written separately:

    <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> a$
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "a" TO "z"
      <a href="#CONT">CONT</a>
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "A" TO "Z"
      <a href="#CONT">CONT</a>
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "ae","oe","ue","ss","Ae","Oe","Ue"
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "OK"
    <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a>

and similarly with ranges:

    <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> a$
    <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> "a" TO "z","A" TO "Z","ae","oe","ue",<a href="#.">.</a>..
    <a href="#.">.</a>..
    <a href="#.">.</a>..

<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 is provided with an unusually large selection of loop types.
Normally one differentiates between 'entry testing' and 'exit testing' loops.
'Entry testing' loops are those, such as <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WEND">WEND</a>, in which the abort
condition for the loop is checked before entry into the loop. While with 'exit
testing loops', such as <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>, this condition is examined at the end of the
loop, consequently such are gone through at least once. A special loop type,
<a href="#DO">DO</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a>, is also available in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a> This type acts as a continuous loop
without an abort condition. In <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> this command can be very flexibly
used. Both after <a href="#DO">DO</a> and after <a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a> the extensions <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> and <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> can be used
so that the loops begin or end with a logical condition. In all of the loop
types mentioned here, as many as abort conditions as required may be used in
the loop body using the <a href="#EXIT_IF">EXIT IF</a> command.

The <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> command (also called a counting loop) is used for repeated
processing a group of instructions between the commands <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> and <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> For this
purpose the count variable c is incremented (or decremented), beginning with
the initial value b, as far as the end value 'e'<a href="#.">.</a>

The instructions in the loop body are gone through, until <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> is reached.
There the count variable c is increased by the value s given after <a href="#STEP">STEP</a><a href="#.">.</a> If no
<a href="#STEP">STEP</a> value is given, then an increment of one is assumed. Next c is checked to
see whether it has exceeded the value e. If this is the case, the loop is
exited and the program continued with the command after the <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> If not, the
program loops back again to the first instruction, this process is repeated,
until c is larger than e. A consequence of this exit method is that c, after
the loop is left, is equal to e+s, i.e. the first value which exceeds the abort
criterion. Also, the contents of a <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop will always be gone through at
least once.

<b>Note:</b> In place of a <a href="#STEP">STEP</a> value of -1 the command <a href="#DOWNTO">DOWNTO</a> can be used instead
      of TO. However, with <a href="#DOWNTO">DOWNTO</a> the use of <a href="#STEP">STEP</a> is not possible.

In general, for the count variable c one should use integer variables, because
thereby the loop can be processed more quickly than with floating-point
variables. This is naturally not possible with non-integer <a href="#STEP">STEP</a> increments. In
place of the command <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> followed by the count variable, the command <a href="#ENDFOR">ENDFOR</a> i%
can be used, but the Interpreter automatically replaces it with <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i%<a href="#.">.</a>

In <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 subroutines, as in most modern programming languages, are given
names. These subroutines can have parameters handed over to them and can then
work on these parameters. There are two forms of parameters available, one
where a value is passed to the subroutine and the second where the variable
itself is passed. In the second case the variable can be changed by the
procedure without the necessity of referring to the variable by name. These two
forms are known as "call by value" and "call by reference"<a href="#.">.</a>

Likewise the use of local variables is possible, i.e. no consideration has to
be taken on possible name clashes when calling procedures or functions. By
means of <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> single-line functions can be defined and addressed using the <a href="#FN">FN</a>
function name. Multi-line functions are also possible. These are a special form
of procedure and return a result (with <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Memo:</b> For compiler options see section <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#Subroutines">Subroutines</a>'<a href="#.">.</a>

      Parameters passed to built in GFA commands are register based.
      Parameters passed to user subroutines are stack based.
        Using no parameters and passing parameters in globals is techincally
        faster but will make your code very hard to read.

Between the commands <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> and <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> are the instructions of a subroutine.
After <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> the name of the subroutine and possibly the list of the
variables to be received are placed. Calling a <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> takes place by giving
its name at the beginning of the line, along with a list of appropriate
parameters, which are placed in parentheses. For the sake of clarity, the
option of placing <a href="#@">@</a> or <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> in front of the procedure name is available. This
also avoids the possibility of confusing procedure names with <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
commands, e.g. @rem, <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> stop. Parameters can be constants, variables, and
expressions. Not only the values, but also variables can be passed (see <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>).

The command <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> is used to end a procedure. When it is reached during the
program execution, the program resumes execution from the instruction after the
<a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a><a href="#.">.</a> In place of the command <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> one can write <a href="#SUB">SUB</a> and instead of

var1, var2: any variable type

<a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters allow variables themselves to be passed and not just their
contents. They make it possible, not only to pass values into a procedure or
function but also, to pass variables which can then be changed within the
procedure or function. If the command <a href="#VAR">VAR</a> is found in the parameter list of a
procedure or function, all of the variables that follow will be treated as
<a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters.

With <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters, unlike with global variables there is no danger of
unintended side-effects. Using <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters complete arrays can be passed.
<a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters are not allowed within the calling line to a procedure or
function, only within its definition.

<b>Note:</b> <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters must always appear as the last elements of a
      parameter list.

The use of <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters is generally quicker than the use of ordinary
parameters or pointers.

<b>Note:</b> In Version 2 it was possible to achieve the effect of passing local
      variables by passing their pointers. Using this method in Version 3 may
      result in the error message 'Pointer (*x) error'<a href="#.">.</a> It is therefore
      strongly recommended that <a href="#VAR">VAR</a>-parameters are used to pass local
      variables.

It is possible using the command <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> to limit the area of application of
variables. The variables specified after <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> are only valid in the procedure
in which the <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> command is used. Also any variables in all subroutines
called by this procedure will be local. Thus it is possible for variables
specified after <a href="#LOCAL">LOCAL</a> to have the same name as variables in the main program,
i.e. global variables. These global variables cannot be addressed then in the
subroutine but are available after leaving the procedure and remain unchanged.

<b>Note:</b> The parameter list given to a procedure or function are always local.

The command <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> allows the definition of single-line functions. These
functions can appear at any point in the program.

The term 'expression' can be any numeric or string expression which can include
any of the parameters x1, x2, etc listed in the definition. These parameters
are local variables to the function, and if they are also globally defined, no
reference can be made to them in the expression as the local variables will be
used instead. When the function is called these variables will contain the
values listed within the brackets of the function call.

<b>Note:</b> The function can be called using either <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#FN">FN</a> func' or '<a href="#@func">@func</a>'<a href="#.">.</a>

Functions can be nested at will, to any depth. However, recursion is not
possible and if attempted, the break-key combination will not work.

<b>Memo:</b> If positioned as the first line of a <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> or <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> definition
      which has no parameters, a bug in the compiler occurs. In the editor it
      seems ok.

      Symptoms: Program works fine in the editor but when compiled acts really
                strange. Doing things you know it should not be doing. The
                problem will persist even if the <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> is not called!

      Further investigation shows that the compiler compiles the functions
      right where it encounters them. Thus, if the <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> is defined inside
      another routine, it jumps over it with a BRAnch always statement.
      This makes for some really messing looking code in the dis-assembler!
      Regardless of where you place them the compiler generates needless
      BRAnch statements anyway, making the binary larger.

      When using this command, do not define them inside other subroutines.
      Best place to put them is between the main body of code and the first
      subroutine or at the very end of the listing after the last subroutine.

      <a href="#'">'</a> works in the editor, fails compiled

      I recommend this command be avoided. The multi-line <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> command is

These three commands control the response to the simultaneous pressing of the
Control, Shift (left shift-key only), and Altemate keys. Normally, pressing
this key combination causes the termination of a program but, it can also be
used to call a particular procedure. To do this, the procedure to be called is
defined by means of the instruction <a href="#ON_BREAK_GOSUB">ON BREAK GOSUB</a> <a href="#proc">proc</a><a href="#.">.</a>

When an <a href="#ON_BREAK_CONT">ON BREAK CONT</a> is present in a program, the Control, Shift, and
Alternate key combination is deactivated. An <a href="#ON_BREAK">ON BREAK</a> reactivates this key
combination once again.

The occurrence of a fault (a TOS or <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> specific fault) normally causes
the output of an error message and an abnormal termination. With <a href="#ON_ERROR_GOSUB">ON ERROR GOSUB</a>
there is the possibility of branching to a specified procedure, following the
detection of an error. In the procedure one can then determine the appropriate
reaction to the error.

With the command <a href="#ON_ERROR">ON ERROR</a> one switches back to the normal error-trapping, so as
to display the appropriate error message and bring about an abnormal
termination. Under these conditions, therefore, when an error arises, an ON
<a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a> command is implemented automatically. In order to be able to react to a
number of errors which occur one after the other, the <a href="#ON_ERROR_GOSUB">ON ERROR GOSUB</a> <a href="#proc">proc</a>
command must be contained within the error-trapping routine.

The <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> command allows one to react in different ways when errors have
arisen and it is only used in an error-trapping procedure. When used on its own
as <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a>', this command causes the error to be repeated. <a href="#RESUME_NEXT">RESUME NEXT</a>
continues execution with the command which follows the command causing the
error. <a href="#RESUME_label">RESUME label</a> causes the program to continue from the point 'label'. The
label for <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> may be located either in a procedure or in the main program.
If a fatal error occurred (see <a href="#FATAL">FATAL</a>), then only <a href="#RESUME_label">RESUME label</a> can be used and
not <a href="#RESUME_NEXT">RESUME NEXT</a> or <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> without a label.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#ON_ERROR_GOSUB">ON ERROR GOSUB</a> error_trapping
    <a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a> 5
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "and again..."
    <a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a> 5
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "is not reached"

    <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> error_trapping
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "Ok, error intercepted"
      <a href="#RESUME_NEXT">RESUME NEXT</a>
    <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> The texts 'Ok, error intercepted' is displayed and then 'and again...'.
    Then the error message 'Square root only for positive numbers', is brought
    about by <a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a> 5. The label for <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> may be located either in a procedure
    or in the main program.

<b>Memo:</b> If the label used with <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> is undefined the compiler will not
      issue and error message.  Instead the compiler writes a bad binary where

With <a href="#ERROR">ERROR</a> x, the occurrence of error number x can be simulated. (For the table
of error messages, see <a href="#Appendix">Appendix</a><a href="#.">.</a>) This command is particularly useful for
example, when testing an error processing routine.

The number of the error that has arisen is returned in the variable <a href="#ERR">ERR</a> and, by
means of this, one can determine the appropriate reaction to the occurrence of
a specific error.

The function <a href="#ERR$">ERR$</a>(x) returns, as a string, the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> error message with the
number x.

The variable <a href="#FATAL">FATAL</a> is true if an error in the program generates an unknown
address. This can happen, for example, when the error arose from the processing
of an operating system routine. When this happens, a <a href="#RESUME">RESUME</a> or <a href="#RESUME_NEXT">RESUME NEXT</a> can
no longer be correctly executed.

procedure to be called once only on the expiration of 'ticks' clock units.

The clock unit (tick) is defined as one two-hundredth of a second so ticks=200
sets an elapsed time of one second. However, a branch to the specified
procedure can only be called on every fourth clock unit, resulting in an
effective time resolution of one fiftieth of a second.

By means of <a href="#EVERY_STOP">EVERY STOP</a>, the calling of a procedure can be prevented on
expiration of the time period. With <a href="#EVERY_CONT">EVERY CONT</a>, the calling of the procedure is
again is allowed. The commands <a href="#AFTER_STOP">AFTER STOP</a> and <a href="#AFTER_CONT">AFTER CONT</a> work similarly, being
implemented internally by means of the etv_timer vector ($400)<a href="#.">.</a>

It is only after the complete processing of a command that a check is made to
ascertain whether such a procedure is to be implemented. Thus commands which
are executed slowly, such as <a href="#INP">INP</a>(2), <a href="#QSORT">QSORT</a>, file operations, or the like, can
obstruct these routines.

execution is commenced from the label position. The label can consist of
letters, numbers, underlines, and periods. However, unlike variable names, it
may also begin with a number. It must, however, end with a colon. The colon
should be left off when refering to a label in a <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a> command.

The use of <a href="#GOTO">GOTO</a> is not allowed for jumping out of procedures, functions, or
<a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loops into the main part of the program. The use of this command also
leads to unclear program structures which are not easy to follow and, it is

The command <a href="#LOAD">LOAD</a> loads a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program. The expression f$ must contain the
file name along with the full access path for the file. When no extension is
specified for the file, the default extension <a href="#'">'</a>.GFA' is used.

<b>Example:</b>

The command <a href="#LIST">LIST</a> displays the current program on the screen. Optionally, an
access path can be specified, by which the program can be stored in <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a>
format. Program sections that are to be inserted in to other programs by means
of 'MERGE', must be saved with <a href="#LIST">LIST</a> or <a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a>,A from the Editor Menu, in <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a>
format.

When no extension is specified for the saving of a file, <a href="#'">'</a>.LST' is used as the
default extension.

By means of the command <a href="#LLIST">LLIST</a>, the current program can be output to the
printer. The printer listing can be interrupted only by the switching off the
printer. Once switched off, the printer will probably continue to print for
some seconds before the program resumes or control is returned to the Editor.
(See <a href="#LLIST">LLIST</a> and the <a href="#.dot_commands">.dot commands</a> in the section covering the Editor.) In
addition, it is also possible to send text to a printer (see <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Examples:</b>

The command <a href="#RUN">RUN</a> starts the current program. Additionally, if a complete file
name with access path is specified, then the appropriate program is loaded and
started, replacing any program currently in memory.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#RUN">RUN</a> "A:\PART2.GFA"

The commands <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a> and <a href="#QUIT">QUIT</a> are equivalent in their effect, as they both
terminate program execution and leave <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a> Unlike in Version 2, <a href="#SYSTEM">SYSTEM</a>

Desktop)<a href="#.">.</a> This integer has a value of zero if the Interpreter was terminated
correctly and left the calling program to hand over to the Desktop.

The convention applied in this case is that zero signals an error free run. A
positive 16 bit number signals the occurrence of an internal error or a warning
and a negative 16 bit number mostly points to the appropriate operating system
error message. However this is not adhered to by all programs.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> 100
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#EXEC">EXEC</a>(0,"GFABASIC.PRG","","")

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> This short program starts by reducing the work space for BASIC to 100
    bytes, it then loads and runs a second copy of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program. If
    the program below is run, the operation of the second copy of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> is
    terminated and returns the value 23 to the original <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a> This value
    will then be printed.

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "This is the second level GFA BASIC"

<b>Memo:</b> Trying to pass error code 0 out is a bit of a problem since

called before the execution of each individual command. The variable <a href="#TRACE$">TRACE$</a>
then contains the command which is to be processed next. The command <a href="#TRON_proc">TRON proc</a>

variables can be output to screen or printer, allowing changes in the variables
to be followed during the course of the program run.

It is important that the <a href="#TRON">TRON</a> procedure should not affect the program itself
while running, so while in use, no <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> commands should be made to the screen
(<a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>, <a href="#ATEXT">ATEXT</a>, <a href="#.">.</a>..) and the use of <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> routines should be avoided because of

Three different graphic modes are available on the Atari ST: one black and
white mode and two color modes. The actual screen coordinates available for the
graphic commands and the colors representable with them depend on the current
resolution. An overview of the available graphic modes is given below:

    <b>Mode       Resolution  Color  Palette      Memory</b>
    ST Low     320x200     16     512/4096     32000

    TT High    1280x960    2      black/white  153600

<b>Note:</b> With the release of the STe the palette was expanded from 512 to
      4096 colors. ST high on the TT is actually duo-chrome, meaning any two
      colors can be used instead of the usual black and white.

In the first section, the commands for the selection of colors (<a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a>,

register, red, green, blue, composite, color: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The command <a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a> determines the line color. Values between 0 and 255,
dependant on the current resolution, are valid.

The first variant of <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> determines the proportion of the colors red,
green, and blue in a particular color register. The intensity of the color
element is specified on a scale from 0 (low) to 15 (high) and the number of
available color registers depends on the current resolution. In the second
variant of <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a>, the color setting is defined by a single parameter whose
value is computed by the following formula:

    composite <a href="#=">=</a> red <a href="#*">*</a> 256 <a href="#+">+</a> green * 16 + blue * 1

and, as with the other setting, the values for red, green, and blue are
specified on a scale from 0 to 15.

The setting of color elements in the color registers is, naturally, only
applicable when in the color modes. However, in the monochrome mode, when a
composite value other than 0 or 1 is specified, even numbers have the same
effect as 0 and odd numbers the same effect as 1.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> 0,0

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> On a mono monitor, the display appears as white on a black background.

Through an apparently unexpected mix-up in the design of the operating system,
the color registers used by <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> do not correspond directly to the numbers
used by <a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a><a href="#.">.</a> To overcome this the command <a href="#VSETCOLOR">VSETCOLOR</a> is available.

The values of red, green, and blue are numbers in the range 0 to 15. The term
composite is calculated in the same manner as <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a>, i.e.<a href="#:">:</a>

    composite <a href="#=">=</a> red <a href="#*">*</a> 256 <a href="#+">+</a> green * 16 + blue * 1

The first <a href="#DEFMOUSE">DEFMOUSE</a> variant determines the current mouse pointer, selected from
the eight pre-defind types. The value of 'symbol' defines the type of the
pointer in the following way:

    0  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Arrow

    1  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Text cursor

   10  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Arrows up and down         NAES

The second variant of the <a href="#DEFMOUSE">DEFMOUSE</a> command allows the user to define a mouse
pointer. The action point, the mask color, the pointer color, the bit design
pattern for the appearance of the mask, and the appearance of the mouse pointer
are specified by means of a character string. The action point, is that point
of the mouse pointer whose coordinates are defined as the mouse position. If
the mouse position is interrogated, it is the coordinates of the action point
which are returned.

All these values must be entered as word size values and the command <a href="#MKI$">MKI$</a><a href="#()">()</a> can
be used for this purpose. Thus, bitpattern$ is assembled as follows:

bitpattern$ <a href="#=">=</a> <a href="#MKI$">MKI$</a>(x-coordinate action point)
            <a href="#+">+</a> <a href="#MKI$">MKI$</a>(y-coordinate action point)

            <a href="#+">+</a> cursor$                         !bit pattern of the cursor

mask$ and cursor$ consist of 16 words each, each word being the bit pattern of
a line.

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> First, a bee appears as a mouse pointer. Then after one second, the mouse
    pointer turns into a line. When the mouse is placed on the black background
    at the center of the screen, the mouse changes to a rectangle, the mask
    having been defined as this rectangle. The final loop is then left by
    pressing a mouse button.

points of a polygon, which are displayed by the command <a href="#POLYMARK">POLYMARK</a><a href="#.">.</a> According to
the actual screen resolution, values between 0 and 255 can be assigned to the
numerical expression 'color' (see the start of this chapter)<a href="#.">.</a> The 'type'
parameter gives the following corner marks:

    3     Star
    4     Square
    5     Cross
    6     Diamond

Values larger than 6 result in the use of the star as the corner mark. Values
for the 'height' of the shape are specified in pixels. Thus a value of 8 will
produce a mark that is 8 x 8 pixels in height. When only the second parameter
or third parameter of the command are required, one can omit the parameter in
question and enter only the parameter-separating commas. Thus,

    <a href="#DEFMARK">DEFMARK</a> ,,4

assignment of values to 'interior'<a href="#:">:</a>

Style can be selected from 24 pattern fills or 12 hatch fills by means of the
'style' parameter (see Appendix: <a href="#Fill_Pattern_Table">Fill Pattern Table</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> Parameters can be
omitted from this definition, as long as the parameter-separating commas are
included. Thus,

    DEFILL ,2,4

selects the fill-pattern 2,4 and leaves the fill color as previously defined.

In the second variation of the command <a href="#DEFFILL">DEFFILL</a>, using the 32 byte parameter
'bitpattern$', a 16 x 16 pixel pattern can be defined. This information must be
presented in word format and can be assembled by means of the <a href="#MKI$">MKI$</a><a href="#()">()</a> command.

The medium resolution fill pattern is represented by two bit-planes which are
combined to define the actual colors produced. The 16 words for the second
bit-plane optionally follow the 16 words of the first.

The first bits from each of these bit-planes are combined, this two bit number
(in the range 0 to 3) represents the color of the pixel at the top left corner
of the block. The second pair of bits represents the color of the second pixel,
to the right of the first, and so on.

For low resolution, four bit-planes are needed to represent a color fill
pattern (one plane could be used but this would giva a single color pattern),
therefore the bit pattern must be 64 words (128 bytes) in length.

The first bit-plane represents the least significant bit of the color. If
however the second of these planes is left off, this will result in a single
color fill pattern, the color being that chosen in the parameter 'color'<a href="#.">.</a>

      If you want the opposite end to be reset to zero that's fine, but
      otherwise this seems odd to me. Normally settings stay set until
      changed, this one is an expection to the rule. To avoid confusion always
      set parameters 'start' and 'end' together.

<b><a href="#DEFTEXT">DEFTEXT</a> [color],[attr],[angle],[height],[fontnr]</b>

color, attr, angle, height, fontnr: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

This command determines the appearance of a character string that is to be
displayed with <a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a><a href="#.">.</a> The parameter 'color', depending on the current
resolution, may contain a value between 0 and 255. The second parameter 'attr'
sets the text attributes which can be created by combinations of the values
given below:

The parameter 'angle' determines the direction of the text characters, the
value being specified in 1/10 degree steps in a clockwise direction.
















<b>Note:</b> However, only the following values are permitted by GEM:

       0  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  From left to right (default)
     900  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  From bottom to top
    1800  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  From right to left, upside down
    2700  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  From top to bottom

If a value other than one of the above is given, the nearest multiple of 900
is used.

The parameter 'height' specifies the text height of a capitol letter in pixels,
and with the normal character set only the following character heights are
actually readable:

     4  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Icon
     6  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Subscript

    32  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Expanded character height

Finally, the parameter 'fontnr' specifies the number of the desired character
set. This font must have previously been installed (see also GDOS:
<a href="#VST_LOAD_FONTS">VST_LOAD_FONTS</a><a href="#()">()</a>, <a href="#VQT_NAME">VQT_NAME</a>(), <a href="#.">.</a>..).

<b><a href="#GRAPHMODE">GRAPHMODE</a> n</b>

n: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The command <a href="#GRAPHMODE">GRAPHMODE</a> determines the way in which graphics is output to the
screen with relation to what is already there and is important when pictures
are to be drawn on top of one another. Four possible modes can be represented
by the numerical expression n:

    1  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Replace
    2  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Transparent
    3  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Xor
    4  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Reverse transparent (inverted and transparent)

When 'n' has the value 1, the new drawing is simply drawn over the existing
screen contents obliterating it completely.

When n is equal to 2, the new drawing is ORed with the existing one, which
means that the old picture can still be seen behind the new one.

With n equal to 3, the new drawing is XORed with the existing one. This means
that, at each pixel where a graphic point was already present, that graphic dot
is deleted, and for all other points, the image is drawn normally. The
importance of this mode is that the process is reversible. By XORing the new
drawing with itself the original screen is restored. Thus, by using this mode,
animation is possible by repeated drawing and 'undrawing' of a figure as it is
moved around the screen.

In the case where n <a href="#=">=</a> 4, the new drawing is inverted and then ORed with the
existing one. In this way, a display similar to mode 2 is produced (n=2), but
the new picture is shown in reverse video.

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i%=1 TO 4

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> Four filled rectangles are drawn, and a further four are drawn partly
    overlapping the previous ones. Each pair is combined using a different

<a href="#PELLIPSE">PELLIPSE</a>, they can be filled with colors or patterns.

<a href="#POLYLINE">POLYLINE</a> draws a polygonal shape, and corner points made up of symbols defined

character strings in arbitrary places on the screen. <a href="#CLS">CLS</a> clears the entire
screen. At the end of the section, the command, <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a> is covered.

The Origin (location 0,0) with all these graphic commands is located in the
top-left corner of the screen. The coordinates of graphic elements can lie
outside the actual screen display area but only the visible parts of the

This group of commands provides the 'Clipping' function, i.e. the limiting of
graphic displays within a specified rectangle screen area. <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> defines a
clipping rectangle for the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> graphic commands. <a href="#ACLIP">ACLIP</a> does this for <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a>
graphic routines. The screen area to be operated on, (clipping rectangle) can
be defined by the coordinates of the diagonally-opposite corner points; as well
as the top-left coordinate and the width and height of the clipping rectangle.

The command <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> x,y,w,h allows the input of the upper y-coordiante 'y', left
x-coordinate 'x' as well as the width 'w' and height 'h' of the clipping
rectangle.

The command <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> x1,y2 TO x2,y2 offers a further option by accepting the
coordinates of diagonally-opposite corner points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2)<a href="#.">.</a>

The third variant makes it possible to define the limits of the window 'n'<a href="#.">.</a>
The optional additional command <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> x0,y0 makes it possible to redefine the
origin of the graphic display.

In addition, the command <a href="#CLIP_OFFSET">CLIP OFFSET</a> x0,y0 can
also be used as a command in its own right, and in this case serves the same
purpose in setting the origin for the graphic displays at the ponit (x0,y0)<a href="#.">.</a>

The command <a href="#CLIP_OFF">CLIP OFF</a> swithes off the clipping function.

The limiting of graphic displays by CLIPping does not apply to the commands
<a href="#GET">GET</a>, <a href="#PUT">PUT</a>, and <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a>, nor to the <a href="#Line-A_calls">Line-A calls</a> (where <a href="#ACLIP">ACLIP</a> should be used) or
<a href="#AES">AES</a> commands.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> #0 sets the clipping rectangle to the Desktop area. It's
      the same as doing this:
        <a href="#~">~</a><a href="#WIND_GET">WIND_GET</a>(0,4,x&amp;,w&amp;,y&amp;,h&amp;)  !desktop handle is always 0
        <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> x&amp;,y&amp;,w&amp;,h&amp; <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> 0,0

      The <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> option is not a real <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> function.  The x/y values are
      actually noted by <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> itself and then internally added to all
      further graphics commands.  Thus if you call the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> directly, this
      <a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a> will have no effect at all, and must be simulated.  The current
      offset is stored in the <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a> structure.

      There's a bug in the startup code related to <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a><a href="#.">.</a> The initial clipping
      rectangle is set from values taken from the <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> variables. Thus it
      fails on non-ST video modes. If the graphics commands appear to be not
      working and you are in some non-ST mode, add this to the top of the
      program: <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a> 0,0 TO <a href="#WORK_OUT">WORK_OUT</a>(0),WORK_OUT(1)

<a href="#PLOT">PLOT</a> draws a point with the coordinates x,y on the screen. <a href="#LINE">LINE</a> draws a line

can be defined by means of the commands <a href="#DEFLINE">DEFLINE</a> and <a href="#COLOR">COLOR</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> x,y corresponds to the command <a href="#PLOT">PLOT</a><a href="#.">.</a> By means of <a href="#DRAW_TO">DRAW TO</a> x,y, a line is
drawn between the coordinates x,y and the last set point, regardless of whether
this point was set by <a href="#PLOT">PLOT</a>, <a href="#LINE">LINE</a>, or <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a><a href="#.">.</a>

A further variant of the command, <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> x1,y1 TO x2,y2 corresponds to the <a href="#LINE">LINE</a>
command, and addionally with this command, further coordinates can be specified
allowing shapes such as polygons to be produced. This latter variant of the
command makes it possible to create structures which are similar to the
turtle-graphic commands of Logo and the Hewlett-Packard standard plotter
language, HPGL. In this way, it is possible to simulate a plotter on the
screen.

With <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> an imaginary pen is moved over the screen and draws relative to the
last point. The <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> command's structure resembles the turtle-graphic commands
of the programming language Logo. The parameters of the <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> command can
contain a large number of individual commands, which are all passed to the
command in the form of a string. Parts of the expression can be given in
floating-point format, allowing for the use of variables. In this 'Logo like'
convention, an imaginary 'pen' is controlled by means of the graphic commands
and its movement over the 'paper' creates the graphic image. The statement
below is given as an example of how these commands may be used:

    <a href="#DRAW">DRAW</a> "FD 100 RT ",angle," PU BK ";50

The available commands are:

FD n  ForwarD          Moves the pen 'n' pixels forward.

BK n  BacKward         Moves the pen 'n' pixels backwards.

SX x  Scale X          Scales the 'pen movement' for FD and BK by the
SY y  Scale Y          specified factor. The scale with SX an SY works only
                       with the commands FD and BK. With SX0 or SY0 the scale
                       is switched off. This is quicker than scaling with the

s_mfdb%<a href="#()">()</a>, d_mfdb%(), par%()<a href="#:">:</a> integer-array

The command <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a> allows the copying of rectangular screen sections. It is
similar to the commands <a href="#GET">GET</a> and <a href="#PUT">PUT</a> but it is quicker and more flexible.
However, it is also more complicated to use.

The parameters of the command are stored in three arrays. The first one,
s_mfdb%<a href="#()">()</a>, contains the structure of the source screen <a href="#-">-</a> the one to be copied.
In the same way, d_mfdb%<a href="#()">()</a> contains the structure of the destination, i.e. the
place where the picture is to be copied to. The third array contains the
coordinates of the source and target areas and also the copy mode.

This command has a <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> routine as its basis. During <a href="#BITBLT_adr%">BITBLT adr%</a> and <a href="#BITBLT_x%()">BITBLT x%()</a>
a <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> routine is called (see the section on <a href="#Line-A_calls">Line-A calls</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

The structure of the source (s_mfdb%) is same as that of the destination screen
(d_mfdb%)<a href="#.">.</a> The abbreviations mean:

    s_mfdb%<a href="#()">()</a> Source Memory Form Description Block
    d_mfdb%<a href="#()">()</a> Destination Memory Form Description Block

The Array Elements are: (<a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 is assumed)

x_mfdb%(0)  Contains the source/destination address. This address must be an
            even number. Usually either s_mfdb%(0) or d_mfdb%(0) equals the
            screen address (<a href="#XBIOS">XBIOS</a>(2))<a href="#.">.</a>
x_mfdb%(1)  Width of the screen in pixels. This value must be divisible by 16.

x_mfdb%(6)  Reserved field. (should be set to 0)
x_mfdb%(7)  Reserved field.
x_mfdb%(8)  Reserved field.

If x_mfdb%(0)=0, the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> will fill in the rest of the x_mfdb() parameters by
itself, pointing to the current screen.

The array par%<a href="#()">()</a> has the following structure:

    par%(0)  Left x-coordinate of the source block
    par%(1)  Upper y-coordinate of the source block
    par%(2)  Right x-coordinate of the source block
    par%(3)  Lower y-coordinate of the source block
    par%(4)  Left x-coordinate of the destination block
    par%(5)  Upper y-coordinate of the destination block
    par%(6)  Right x-coordinate of the destination block
    par%(7)  Lower y-coordinate of the destination block

The TT does not have a constant screen memory of 32000 bytes like the ST. A
screen could require much more memory (153600 bytes)<a href="#.">.</a> The commands <a href="#GET">GET</a> and <a href="#PUT">PUT</a>

support the larger screen resolutions that require more than 32000 bytes.

This function will return the number of bytes required by the screen between
the coordinates x1,y1 and x2,y2. Several <a href="#GET">GET</a> or <a href="#PUT">PUT</a> commands could be used to
address the entire screen.

Note: If any of the coordinates are offscreen, this function returns 0.

There are commands in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> which allow the monitoring of GEM Events in a
straightforward way. These events are the pressing of a key or a mouse button,
the arrival of the mouse pointer inside or outside one of two specified
rectangular screen areas, and the arrival of a 'GEM message', in which
information about window management is passed.

The monitoring of these events is set up by <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> xxx <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a>, where xxx is the
event to be reacted to, and is actually invoked within a program by the <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a>
command. Each time this command is encountered, a check is made to see if an
Event has occured. If so, and if there was a previous <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> xxx <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> to
define the reaction to that event, then the program branches to the appropriate
procedure.

<b><a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> [t]</b>

t: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The command <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> supervises Event handling. Before using it, the required
reaction should have been specified with an <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> xxx <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> command, the
variants of which are explained in the remainder of this chapter. For constant
supervision of Events it is necessary to use this command repeatedly. For this
reason, the <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> command is normally found in a loop.

The parameter 't' contains the time (in thousandths of a second) to elapse
before the <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> command is terminated. The reason for this delay is that
occasionally GEM does not notice the releasing of a mouse button (typical
effect: When the 'Close' box of a window is clicked, the window sometimes
remains open until the button is energetically clicked a few times)<a href="#.">.</a> By giving
a suitable value to 't', this should be prevented.

It is a good idea to use the parameter 't' even if a program is not
specifically concerned with the mouse buttons, as other programs, or GEM
routines called from within it, may do so.

    mouse button ends the program. If one changes the first line to <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a>
    BUTTON 0,0,0 <a href="#GOSUB">GOSUB</a> test' then the mouse monitoring is switched off, and the

<a href="#ON_MENU_GOSUB">ON MENU GOSUB</a>
<a href="#MENU">MENU</a>, <a href="#MENU_OFF">MENU OFF</a>, <a href="#MENU_KILL">MENU KILL</a>

In this section the commands specific to GFA BASIC 3 for control of
pull-down-menus are given. Unfortunately a certain confusion prevails in the
literature on this topic as to the meaning of some of the terms used. They
shall therefore be stated here as they are used in this manual. We use the term
'pull-down-menu' as a general term for menu titles or headings. In the top
screen line the constantly visible part of the menu, is where the menu list is
located. This contains the individual headings. If the mouse arrow arrives at
one of these headings, then under it a so-called menu which unfolds.  Each part
of this menu can be selected individually as a menu entry. This choice of
terminology is not generally obligatory but is used throughout this manual,
elsewhere slightly different definitions are used.

During the creation of a menu its entries are set in an array m$<a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> With the
command <a href="#MENU">MENU</a> m$<a href="#()">()</a> this pull-down-menu is displayed on the screen. The command
<a href="#ON_MENU_GOSUB">ON MENU GOSUB</a> determines which procedure the program branches to on the
selection of a menu entry. When the program is running, a check is made to see
whether an entry was selected on each occurrence of an <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> command.

The command <a href="#MENU_OFF">MENU OFF</a> returns reverse video entries in the menu list to normal
display. With <a href="#MENU_KILL">MENU KILL</a> the menu is switched off. The command <a href="#MENU">MENU</a> x,y enables
menu entries to be provided with checkmarks or to be displayed in light text,
making this menu entry non-selectable.

<b>Memo:</b> If the procedure used with <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> is undefined the compiler will
      not issue and error message. Instead the compiler writes a bad binary
      where <a href="#ON_MENU">ON MENU</a> is translated into JSR 0.l!

With <a href="#ON_MENU_GOSUB">ON MENU GOSUB</a> <a href="#proc">proc</a>, the procedure to which control will be passed on
selection of a menu entry is determined. If an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> is currently open, the
procedure will not be called. Within the procedure, which menu entry was
selected can be found by using the variable <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(0)<a href="#.">.</a> MENU(0) is the <a href="#index">index</a> of
the selected entry in the array of the entries m$<a href="#()">()</a>, and m$(<a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(0)) indicates
the text clicked on the menu if <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0 is currently selected. If <a href="#OPTION">OPTION</a>
BASE 1 has been chosen, then the text of the selected item is in m$(<a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(0)+1)<a href="#.">.</a>

The command <a href="#MENU">MENU</a> m$<a href="#()">()</a> puts the menu onto the screen. The string array m$()
contains the headings, entries and reserved space for the <a href="#accessories">accessories</a><a href="#.">.</a> The
following format must be used during the arrangement of the entries in the
array m$()<a href="#:">:</a>

    m$(0)          Heading of the first menu in which <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> can exist.

    m$(1)          Name of the first entry in the first menu.

    m$(2)          A line of minus signs.

    m$(3) <a href="#-">-</a> m$(8)  Reserved space for <a href="#accessories">accessories</a><a href="#.">.</a> These elements need only be
                   a single character long, as their contents are ignored. If
                   an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> was loaded when the computer was switched on,
                   this will take up one of these strings. Otherwise they will
                   not be printed.

    m$(9)          An empty string, which marks the end of the first menu.

All further menus have the following format:

    1. Heading of the menu.
    2. List of the menu entries.
    3. An empty string which marks the end of the menu.

After the last menu another further empty-string marks the end of the entire
Pull-down-menu. A menu entry which begins with a minus sign is represented but
is not selectable and is shown in light text.

<a href="#MENU_OFF">MENU OFF</a> returns a menu title to 'normal video' display mode. (After an item is
chosen from a menu, the menu title is displayed in inverse video)<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#MENU_KILL">MENU KILL</a> deactivates a menu but does not, however, remove the menu title list
from the screen. In addition <a href="#MENU_KILL">MENU KILL</a> turns off the <a href="#ON_MENU_GOSUB">ON MENU GOSUB</a> options.

With the <a href="#MENU">MENU</a> x,y instruction the x-th entry in a menu can be given certain
attributes. The numbering of the entries corresponds to the indexing of the
array of menu entries, counting from zero and including titles, entries for
Accessories and null strings ("")<a href="#.">.</a>

The second parameter y specifies the attribute to be given, or removed from,
the x-th menu entry as follows:

    <b>y  Effect</b>
    0  Checkmark to be removed, if present, from in front of a menu item
    1  Checkmark to be placed in front of a menu item <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> &#10003;
    2  Menu item to be made non-selectable, and printed in light characters
    3  Menu item to be made selectable, and written in normal characters

With the <a href="#MENU">MENU</a> x,text$ instruction the x-th entry of a menu can have it's text
altered. The numbering of the entries corresponds to the indexing of the array
of menu entries, counting from zero and including titles, entries for
Accessories and null strings ("")<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#AES">AES</a> routines will need to be used (see <a href="#Chapter_11_-_AES_Libraries">Chapter 11 - AES Libraries</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>
Additionally the functions <a href="#W_HAND">W_HAND</a><a href="#()">()</a> and <a href="#W_INDEX">W_INDEX</a>() are available as a link
between the simpler window management commands and the more extensive <a href="#AES">AES</a>
functions in the <a href="#Window_Library">Window Library</a><a href="#.">.</a>

With the simplest of the instructions, <a href="#OPENW">OPENW</a>, all four windows share a common
corner, their other corners all lying on the screen edges. When this method is
used, only one pair of coordinates is needed to define the size and position of
all four windows, these being the coordinates of the common corner.

After a window has been opened, most commands (<a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>, <a href="#PRINT_AT">PRINT AT</a>, <a href="#TEXT">TEXT</a>, etc.)
will take as their origin, the top left corner of the work-area of the window,
but commands such as <a href="#GET">GET</a>, <a href="#PUT">PUT</a>, and <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a>, which access the screen memory
directly, will still take the top left corner of the screen for their origin.
Graphics and text which leave the current window area are automatically
clipped.

required for more flexible window management. The coordinates of the possible
windows set up with this instruction (assuming high-resolution mode) will be:

The point (x_pos,y_pos) is thus the point of contact of the four possible
windows.

With the instruction <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#OPENW">OPENW</a> 0' no genuine window is opened, but the coordinate
origin is moved to (0,19)<a href="#.">.</a> Thus the upper 19 lines of the screen are protected
from graphical or text output. This usually protects a menu bar against
accidental overwriting.

The instruction <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#CLOSEW">CLOSEW</a> n' closes the window with number n, 'CLOSEW #n'
closes the window with the arbitrarily assigned number n. (See also example
program at the end of this section.)

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>
      <a href="#IF">IF</a> <a href="#MOUSEK">MOUSEK</a>=1

    pressing the right mouse button opens window 1 and closes window 4.
    Simultaneously pressing both mouse buttons terminates the program.

The second variant, <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#OPENW">OPENW</a> #n', opens a window with the arbitrarily assigned
number 'n', with the position, size, and attributes specified in x, y, w, h,

sliders, etc.) the window is to have (see <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a><a href="#()">()</a> below or <a href="#WIND_CREATE">WIND_CREATE</a>() in
the <a href="#AES">AES</a> section)<a href="#.">.</a> 'n' is then the number to be used with <a href="#TITLEW">TITLEW</a>, <a href="#INFOW">INFOW</a>, etc. <a href="#-">-</a>
it is <a href="#NOT">NOT</a> the GEM 'handle' of the window.

<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#CLOSEW">CLOSEW</a> #n' closes such a window.

The value of <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a> gives the address of the Window Parameter table, where the
information which determines the appearance of a window is stored. The next
piece of information following the table is the coordinates of the graphics
origin.

The table consists of 68 bytes and is constructed in word (2-byte) format. The
use of the table is shown at the end of the section in a sample program, where
the parameters of the window to be created are placed directly into the window
table and the window then opened with a simple <a href="#OPENW">OPENW</a> instruction.

<a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a>, in a similar way to <a href="#INTIN">INTIN</a><a href="#()">()</a>, etc., can be used as a two-dimensional
array, <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> The first <a href="#index">index</a> refers to the number of the window (1 to 4,
or 0)<a href="#.">.</a> Zero is a special case and refers to the Desktop. The second <a href="#index">index</a> is:

    0  Handle
    1  Attributes
    2  x-coordinate
    3  y-coordinate
    4  Width
    5  Height

The Window Parameter table can also be modified by using
<a href="#'">'</a><a href="#DPOKE">DPOKE</a> <a href="#WINDTAB">WINDTAB</a>+offset', the offsets have the following meanings:

    <b>Offset  Description</b>

     4      Window 1: x-coordinate

     8      Window 1: Width
    10      Window 1: Height
    12-22   Window 2: Handle, Attributes, x, y, w, h
    24-34   Window 3: Handle, Attributes, x, y, w, h

<a href="#GET">GET</a>, and <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a> always use the top left corner of the screen as their origin.

The window attribute word is constructed bit by bit, with each set bit denoting
the presence of a particular window component.

The instruction <a href="#RC_COPY">RC_COPY</a> makes possible the copying of rectangular 'screen'
sections between areas of memory, each of which represents a screen display
which may be sent to the monitor by specifying the screen address appropriately
(see <a href="#XBIOS">XBIOS</a>(2))<a href="#.">.</a> The parameters s_adr and d_adr contain the starting addresses
of the source and destination screens. The coordinates of the top left corner
and the width and height of the rectangle to be copied should be specified in
sx, sy, w, and h. The coordinates of the top left corner of the destination
rectangle are dx and dy. An optional logical operation may be preformed between
the source and destination rectangles, given by 'm' in the range 0 to 15 (see
<a href="#PUT">PUT</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> The default value for 'm' is 3 (replace mode).

message$, button$<a href="#:">:</a> <a href="#sexp">sexp</a>
choice: <a href="#avar">avar</a>

The command <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a> creates an Alert box. The expression 'icon' determines which
icon is to appear in the box. The following are valid:

    <b>icon  Image</b>
    <a href="#-">-</a>---  -------------------------

    <a href="#=">=</a>&gt;4   See <a href="#FORM_ALERT">FORM_ALERT</a><a href="#()">()</a>

The text to appear in the box is given by the expression 'message$'<a href="#.">.</a> A maximum
of 4 lines is permitted, with a maximum of 30 characters per line, seperated
by 'pipe' (<a href="#|">|</a>) characters. Lines which are longer than 30 characters are
truncated.

The expression 'default' specifies which of the box's buttons is to be the one
with a bold border, selectable by pressing Return or Enter. As no more than
three buttons are allowed, 'default' can take a value form 0 to 3, 0 indicating
that there will be no default button and selection can only be made by clicking
with the mouse.

The string expression 'button$' contains the text for the buttons, with a
maximum of 8 characters per button. The individual button are seperated by
'pipe' (<a href="#|">|</a>) characters. Buttons which are longer than 8 characters are
truncated.

On exiting from the Alert box, the variable 'choice' contains the number (1 to
3) of the selected button (see <a href="#FORM_ALERT">FORM_ALERT</a><a href="#()">()</a>)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a> 1,"Pick a|button",1,"Left|Right",a%

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> A box with two buttons appears. After the selection has been made a second
    box materialises stating which button in the first box was chosen. The
    second Alert box has no icon and no default button.

<b>Memo:</b> Values larger than 3 for parameter 'icon' do not work.
      To use the newer alert icons one must call <a href="#FORM_ALERT">FORM_ALERT</a><a href="#()">()</a> instead. <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a>
      can be fatal on some <a href="#AES">AES</a> versions if the default button exceeds the
      actual button count.

      Internally, the Editor uses d7 to save and restore the stack during
      these system calls. If d7 is altered by a custom trap handler the Editor
      will crash. UNSQUISH.PRG does this with two custom calls. In my opinion
      DC Squish II is to blame here as it breaks the most basic OS rules.

<a href="#HLINE">HLINE</a> is similar to the <a href="#ALINE">ALINE</a> command, but only horizontal lines can be drawn.
x1 and x2 contain the x-coordinates of the line end points, and y the common
y-coordinate. The expression f contains the color which, depending on the
current screen resolution, takes values from 0 to 15. The parameter m
determines the graphics mode as with <a href="#ALINE">ALINE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

addr is the address of a block of memory which contains bit information for
several line styles (each 16 bits)<a href="#.">.</a> Which style is used for a given line
depends on both the y-coordinate and the parameter num_pattern. They are ANDed
together and the resulting number used as an <a href="#index">index</a> to the style table. Thus
num_pattern should generally be one smaller than the power of two (0, 1, 3, 7,
15, etc.), giving the effect that, with num_pattern=7, the first eight styles
will be used sequentially as the y-coordinate moves down the screen. If
num_pattern=3, one of the first four styles will be used, depending on the
y-coordinate.

The command <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a> calls the <a href="#Line-A">Line-A</a> routine of the same name, where as the
command with three parameter arrays calls a <a href="#VDI">VDI</a>-routine. In the command
variation for which an address is given as a parameter, a 76 byte long table
must start at this address. The meaning of the values in this storage area can
be taken from the table that follows. The offset distances of the elements from
the start of the table are shown in the column 'offset'<a href="#.">.</a>

In the command variation with the one four byte-Integer array, this array must
have at least 23 elements, a specified parameter standing in each. Which
parameter must stand in which array element can be seen in the column <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#index">index</a>'
in the following table.

The parameters marked with a star are affected by the routine, therefore one
should normally work with the command variant which uses an array parameter,
since a copy of the array is used by the <a href="#BITBLT">BITBLT</a> routine, the array itself will
not be altered. In contrast, the table elements which were given by the passing
of an address will be changed.

<b>Memo:</b> Programs which use the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> to do all graphics output will work on
      machines equiped with video graphics cards.

      The compiler only initializes the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> if some module is linked that
      actually calls the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a><a href="#.">.</a> The editor on the other hand always does this.
      If you suspect the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> is not initialized it can be forced with a
      call to any <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> function. I suggest using some inquire function like
      <a href="#~">~</a><a href="#POINT">POINT</a>(0,0)<a href="#.">.</a>

      When GFA starts up, it opens a workstation and copies the handle to
      <a href="#CONTRL">CONTRL</a>(6)<a href="#.">.</a> This is why you don't need set CONTRL(6) when writing custom

The following <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> Workstation and query functions are available only if GDOS
(release 1.0 and later) has been installed and a valid ASSIGN.SYS file is
available.

The machine independent GDOS (Graphics DEVICE Operating System) contains
graphics functions and works together with device dependant drivers for
different output devices (screen, printer, plotter, metafiles, etc.).

The <a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> file ASSIGN.SYS contains all necessary data concerning the current
device configuration. In this file all current Operating System and character
sets must be registered, and if necessary the access path to the Operating
System must be specified, if it is not on drive A:. The following syntax should
be noted:

    PATH=d:\path\
    id DEVICE.SYS
    <a href="#;">;</a> Remarks
    PART1.FNT
    PART2.FNT
    <a href="#.">.</a>..
    PARTN.FNT

id contains a number between 1 and 32767. With it the type of device is
determined as follows:

    01  <a href="#.">.</a>..  Screen
    11  <a href="#.">.</a>..  Plotter
    21  <a href="#.">.</a>..  Printer

    41  <a href="#.">.</a>..  Camera
    51  <a href="#.">.</a>..  Graphic-Tablet

If the Operating System is located on drive <a href="#C:">C:</a> in the folder <a href="#GEMSYS">GEMSYS</a>, then the
associated ASSIGN.SYS file looks, for example, like this:

    PATH=c:\gemsys\
    01p SCREEN.SYS ;Screen driver in ROM, therefore a 'p' after the ID
    ATSS10.FNT
    ATSS12.FNT

    ATSS12EP.FNT
    31 META.SYS    ;Metafile driver
    ATSS10MF.FNT
    ATSS12MF.FNT

The screen drivers SCREEN.SYS are only dummy entries, required by the GDOS
syntax checker. The ID's (2, 3, and 4) have only to assign, for each
resolution, the order of the given fonts. Therefore the call to open a virtual
screen memory workstation is <a href="#V_OPNVWK">V_OPNVWK</a>(<a href="#XBIOS">XBIOS</a>(4)+2))<a href="#.">.</a> <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 makes this call

x, y: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

The function <a href="#C:">C:</a> calls a C or assembler subroutine, located at the address addr.
The parameters in brackets (x, y...) will be passed to the routine. The
parameter passing is via the stack, as in C. The parameters can be sent as
32-bit longwords with the prefix <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#L:">L:</a>', or 16-bit words with the prefix '<a href="#W:">W:</a>'<a href="#.">.</a>
If there is no prefix, a word value will be sent. When the function is called,
first the return address and then the parameters will be found on the stack.

So, for example:

<a href="#VOID">VOID</a> C:adr%(L:x,W:y,z) leads to the following situation on the stack:

      (sp)  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Return address (4 bytes)
     4(sp)  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  x (4 bytes)

<b><a href="#MONITOR">MONITOR</a> [x]</b>

x: <a href="#iexp">iexp</a>

This instruction enables one to call assembler subroutines or debugging
programs or other utilities. For this purpose the 'illegal instruction vector'
(address 16) must be set to the address of the subroutine. The <a href="#MONITOR">MONITOR</a>
instruction then produces an illegal Instruction exception, which causes the
computer to branch to the subroutine. This subroutine must end with RTE (ReTurn
from Exception)<a href="#.">.</a> The parameter x is passed to the subroutine in register d0.

An example of its use is with tracing a C program, using a debugger. <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
should be loaded and started from the debugger. Then, after inputting the C
program, insert the line <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#MONITOR">MONITOR</a> asm%' directly before the <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> statement.
After the start of the C program the debugger will respond because of the
'Illegal Instruction exception' generated by the <a href="#MONITOR">MONITOR</a> command. Now one can
disassemble, single-step or edit the C program at the address now in register
d0. When the C program has been edited/examined satisfactorily, one can
continue the execution of the program with the 'GO' instruction of the
debugger. If the 'Break' keys Shift-Control-Alternate are pressed whilst in the
debugger, a flag will be set which will cause the BASIC program to halt as soon
as control is returned to it.

<b>CAUTION:</b>

Before using this command you must make sure that a machine language monitor
has initialized the monitor vector. <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> cannot set this vector before
the jump to its address because it does not know where the monitor is. If the
monitor is not at the current vector address this results in the program or
system crash (bombs error #4)<a href="#.">.</a>

Assembler or C subroutines can also be called with the instruction <a href="#CALL">CALL</a>, where
'addr' is the address of the assembler program, which must end with an RTS
instruction. It is possible to pass a parameter list to the routine.  When the
<a href="#CALL">CALL</a> is made, the return address is found at the top of the stack followed by
the number of parameters given as a 16-bit word, and finally the address, as a
32-bit longword, of the parameter list. All parameters will be put into memory
as long (32-bit) words.

Strings may also be passed to the subroutine, in which case it will be the
address of the string which is found in the parameter list.

Stack structure:

     (sp)  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Return address
    4(sp)  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a>  Number of parameters (16-bit)

The instruction <a href="#RCALL">RCALL</a> enables the assembler routine to start with pre-allocated
values in the registers, and the BASIC program to query the register contents
when the routine returns. The integer-sized array reg%<a href="#()">()</a>, which must have at
least 16 elements, serves this purpose. Before the assembler routine is
started, the entries in this array are automatically copied into the
appropriate registers. At the end of the routine the contents of the registers
are written back into the appropriate elements. The registers and array
elements are related as follows (assuming <a href="#OPTION_BASE">OPTION BASE</a> 0)<a href="#:">:</a>

<a name="TT?"></a><a name="STE?"></a><b><a href="#STE?">STE?</a>
<a href="#TT?">TT?</a></b>

These commands allow one to detect which hardware your <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programs are
running on.

The function <a href="#STE?">STE?</a> returns the following:
    0 <a href="#=">=</a> Stereo 8-bit playback not available
    2 <a href="#=">=</a> Stereo 8-bit playback available

    Correct use would be stereo_dma!<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#STE?">STE?</a> which generates a TRUE/FALSE result.
    It actually interogates bit #1 of the _SND cookie and shouldn't be used
    to detect an STE machine.

The function <a href="#TT?">TT?</a> returns the following:
    0 <a href="#=">=</a> 68000 (normal ST)
    1 <a href="#=">=</a> 68030 or 68020
    3 <a href="#=">=</a> 68881 or 68882 fitted

    This funtion won't correctly detect an 68000 with an FPU add-on. If a
    68000 is detected the FPU cookie isn't checked. Thus a value of 2 is
    impossible.

These functions can use an FPU: <a href="#SIN">SIN</a>, <a href="#COS">COS</a>, <a href="#TAN">TAN</a>, <a href="#EXP">EXP</a>, <a href="#LOG">LOG</a>, and <a href="#LOG10">LOG10</a>

<b>Example:</b>

    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#STE?">STE?</a> !Prints 2 if ran on an Atari STe
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> <a href="#TT?">TT?</a>  !Prints 3 if ran on an Atari TT030

<b>Memo:</b> These functions should not be used to determine what hardware an
      application might be running on, instead look in the system cookie jar.
      The cookie jar contains much more detailed information about the
      hardware.

      The <a href="#STE?">STE?</a> function doesn't seem to work as the documentation states.
      Original documentation states this:
      The function <a href="#STE?">STE?</a> returns -1 for STE (or TT), otherwise 0.

      The <a href="#TT?">TT?</a> function doesn't seem to work as the documentation states.
      Original documentation states this:
      The function <a href="#TT?">TT?</a> returns -1 for 68020 or 68030 processor, otherwise 0.

      The <a href="#TT?">TT?</a> function when compiled uses self modifying code and thus is
      rather unstable if used on a cpu (68040/060) with the caches enabled.
      If enabled it uses a flaster 'float to integer' <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> BFFFO.

      These functions <a href="#SIN">SIN</a>, <a href="#COS">COS</a>, <a href="#TAN">TAN</a>, <a href="#EXP">EXP</a>, <a href="#LOG">LOG</a>, and <a href="#LOG10">LOG10</a> by default do not use
      the FPU even if present.  The function <a href="#TT?">TT?</a> must be called at least once
      to activate the faster math functions.  It cannot be disabled once
      activated.  Example:

      <a href="#CLS">CLS</a>

This chapter gives an overview of the <a href="#AES_Library">AES Library</a> (<a href="#AES">AES</a> <a href="#=">=</a> Application
Environment Services)<a href="#.">.</a> A detailed description of these routines would be beyond
the scope of this manual (we refer the reader to the extensive literature
already published on GEM), hence information is given in compressed form, as
follows:

    a) The name of the appropriate library routine.
    b) A short description of the function.
    c) The complete GFA BASIC 3 syntax for the function call, with the meaning
       of all the applicable variables explained.

The chapter closes with longer example programs.

Before beginning the descriptions of the functions in the 11 <a href="#AES">AES</a> Libraries, it
is important that the reader becomes familiar with the most important data
structures used by the <a href="#AES">AES</a><a href="#.">.</a> These are the <a href="#OBJECT">OBJECT</a>, <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a>, <a href="#ICONBLK">ICONBLK</a>, <a href="#CICONBLK">CICONBLK</a>,
<a href="#BITBLK">BITBLK</a>, <a href="#APPLBLK">APPLBLK</a>, and <a href="#PARMBLK">PARMBLK</a> structures.

The following <a href="#AES">AES</a> functions are implemented in a similar way to GFA BASIC
version 2:

    <a href="#GB">GB</a>
    <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>
    <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>
    <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a>
    <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>
    <a href="#ADDROUT">ADDROUT</a>

They represent the addresses of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> parameter blocks. Specifically:

    <a href="#GB">GB</a>      <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Parameter block
    <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a> <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Control block
    <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Integer Input block
    <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a> <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Integer Output block
    <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>  <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Address Input block
    <a href="#ADDROUT">ADDROUT</a> <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> address of the <a href="#AES">AES</a> Address Output block

With an <a href="#index">index</a> in brackets after these functions, the appropriate parameter
positions within the block are accessed directly, for instance, x=<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(3)
corresponds to x=<a href="#DPEEK">DPEEK</a>(<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>+6), or GCONTRL(3)=x corresponds to <a href="#DPOKE">DPOKE</a>
<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>+6,x.

<a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>, <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>, and <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a> expect words (2 bytes) as their parameters,
whereas <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a> and <a href="#ADDROUT">ADDROUT</a> expect long words (4 bytes)<a href="#.">.</a> So ADDRIN(2)=x
corresponds to <a href="#LPOKE">LPOKE</a> <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>+2*4,x.

The <a href="#GB">GB</a> block address cannot be used with an <a href="#index">index</a>, on grounds of compatibility
with ST-BASIC; with <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a> etc. indices are available. For example, the second
long word in the <a href="#GB">GB</a> block ({GB+4}) is the address of the GEM internal global
array.

<b>Memo:</b> Not all TOS machines have the same <a href="#AES">AES</a> version so care should be
      taken when calling these functions. For the most part all <a href="#AES">AES</a> calls in
      <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> work fine except a few. Functions denoted in lower case are not
      built into <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a>

      These tables have the following limits:
      <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>(0-5)
      <a href="#GINTIN">GINTIN</a>(0-19)
      <a href="#GINTOUT">GINTOUT</a>(0-19)
      <a href="#ADDRIN">ADDRIN</a>(0-9)
      <a href="#ADDROUT">ADDROUT</a>(0-9)

      <a href="#GB">GB</a>  +0 <a href="#GCONTRL">GCONTRL</a>    6 words

      If you suspect the <a href="#AES">AES</a> is not initialized it can be forced with a

      Some of these arrays appear to be larger than needed. Per TOS 4.04 sources:

So the memory requirements of an object are these 24 bytes plus further
descriptive structures, e.g. <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a> or <a href="#BITBLK">BITBLK</a> structures.

<a href="#OB_NEXT">OB_NEXT</a> points to the following object on the same level, or, if it is the last

<a href="#OB_HEAD">OB_HEAD</a> points to the object's first child, or contains -1 if none.

<a href="#OB_TAIL">OB_TAIL</a> points to the object's last child, or contains -1 if none.

The value -1 in this context is also referred to as NIL (Not In List)<a href="#.">.</a>

Depending on the value in <a href="#OB_TYPE">OB_TYPE</a>, <a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a> has the address of different data

For G_BOX, G_IBOX and G_BOXCHAR, <a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a> contains information concerning
character-content, border-type and color of the appropriate object. The upper 8

appear in the box.

They contain the following values for the border:

             0 <a href="#=">=</a> no border
     1 to  128 <a href="#=">=</a> the border extends 1 to 128 pixels inside the object
    -1 to -128 <a href="#=">=</a> the border extends 1 to 128 pixels outside the object

The bit allocation for the object color word is:

<a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> The file "DIALOG.RSC" is loaded, the address of the object tree is
    determined and the object tree coordinates are centered.

    Then the function <a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a><a href="#()">()</a> is used to define the initial editable strings:

    <a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns a pointer to a <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a> structure, which itself contains
    pointers to data pertaining to editable text (validation string, color,
    text, and template addresses, etc.). So the 'pointer path' to the actual
    information is shown overleaf:

    <b>Object <a href="#-">-</a>-<a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a> structure --&gt; String</b>

    <a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a>(tree%,ch_name%) returns a pointer to the <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a> structure.

    {<a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a>(tree%,ch_name%)} returns the address held at that point in
    <a href="#TEDINFO">TEDINFO</a><a href="#.">.</a>

    <a href="#CHAR">CHAR</a>{{<a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a>(tree%,ch_name%)}} gives the string initially inserted by the
    Resource Construction Set, in this case: 0123456789012345678901.

    <a href="#CHAR">CHAR</a>{{<a href="#OB_SPEC">OB_SPEC</a>(tree%,ch_name%)}}<a href="#=">=</a>"Sherlock'" assigns this preset character
    string a new value (namely 'Sherlock')<a href="#.">.</a> This is repeated for the rest of
    the initial data.

    Then the object tree is drawn and, inside the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop, the main
    <a href="#FORM_DO">FORM_DO</a><a href="#()">()</a> routine is called. Its returned value 'ex%' determines when the
    loop is exited.

    The (edited) strings are then put back into their respective variables,
    after which the object status (found by <a href="#OB_STATE">OB_STATE</a><a href="#()">()</a>) of the 'radio' buttons
    is examined in a <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop. Specifically, Bit 0 is tested with <a href="#BTST">BTST</a><a href="#()">()</a>.
    If it is set (=1), then the corresponding button must have been selected
    (only one radio button can be selected at a time), and the object number of
    the button is stored in radio%<a href="#.">.</a>

    Finally the memory space reserved for the Resource is released again with
    <a href="#RSRC_FREE">RSRC_FREE</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> (This is important!!, since otherwise the available free
    memory shrinks each time the program is started, which soon causes the
    computer to crash.)

    The button which caused the exit of the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop is printed (6 <a href="#=">=</a>
    Cancel, 7 <a href="#=">=</a> Ok), followed by the data strings as they were when <a href="#FORM_DO">FORM_DO</a><a href="#()">()</a>
    was done for the last time and the object number of the last-selected radio
    button.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Compatibility_with_GFA-BASIC_2">Compatibility with GFA-BASIC 2</h2>
It is possible in GFA BASIC 3 to use programs from older <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> versions.
For this purpose, programs written in the earlier version must be stored as
<a href="#ASCII">ASCII</a> files, using the <a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a>,A command. They can then be loaded into Version 3
by means of MERGE and, there after, treated as <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 programs being SAVEd
and LOADed in the normal way.

Version 3 contains all the commands which are in earlier versions of the
interpreter, although there are some small differences in the interpretation of
commands which may make some modification of earlier programs necessary.

<b><a href="#MUL">MUL</a>, <a href="#DIV">DIV</a></b>

The commands <a href="#MUL">MUL</a> and <a href="#DIV">DIV</a> work in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 with integer variables (<a href="#|">|</a>,&amp;,<a href="#%">%</a>) and
integer parameters only.

In the earlier versions, the program:

    a%=10
    <a href="#MUL">MUL</a> a%,2.5
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a%

produced the output 25.

In Version 3, however, <a href="#MUL">MUL</a> does not take account of the fractional parts of
inputs, treating them all as integers. Thus, the value to the right of the
decimal point is ignored, so, in the above example, the integer a% is set to
20. This incompatibility between versions is the price paid for these commands
being many times faster than their counterparts in the earlier versions of
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>, the increase in speed coming from the use of true integer
arithmetic. This incompatibility does, of course, only apply to integer
variables.

<b><a href="#PRINT_USING">PRINT USING</a></b>

<a href="#PRINT_USING">PRINT USING</a> displays only the numbers that fit in the designated format.  This
can mean that it is possible that wrong values will be displayed, instead of
wrong formats as in earlier versions, if the length of the number is too great.
The actual accuracy is, of course, not affected just the display. Care must
therefore be taken when using this command.

<b><a href="#CLS">CLS</a>, <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a>, <a href="#TAB">TAB</a><a href="#()">()</a></b>

At <a href="#CLS">CLS</a>, the string ESC-E-CR is now issued, so that the <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> command will be
able to treat <a href="#TAB">TAB</a><a href="#()">()</a> correctly.

<b><a href="#KEYPAD">KEYPAD</a></b>

A program, which queries the keys of the numeric key-pad and Alternate and/or
Control, requires that a <a href="#KEYPAD">KEYPAD</a> 0 be issued to switch this off now.  The same
is valid for the function keys with Alternate.

<b><a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a>, <a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a></b>

If windows are active and <a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a> or <a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a> are interrogated, then negative
coordinates arise above and to the left of the window border (e.g. <a href="#CLIP">CLIP</a>
<a href="#OFFSET">OFFSET</a>)<a href="#.">.</a> In Version 2.x <a href="#CARD">CARD</a>(<a href="#MOUSEX">MOUSEX</a>) or CARD(<a href="#MOUSEY">MOUSEY</a>) returned these values.

<b><a href="#OPTION">OPTION</a></b>

In version 2 the command <a href="#OPTION">OPTION</a> was used to control the compiler. This command
has been replaced by the <a href="#$">$</a> command in version 3.

<b>Licence</b>

Programs written to run in Interpreted mode can be run by means of the Run-only
Interpreter which is supplied with the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Interpreter. This contains all
the routines necessary for the running of <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programs and can be
distributed by bonafide <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> owners along with their programs, thus
allowing all ST users to run any software written in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a> The Interpreter
itself is sold for use by the owner, on one machine and copies may not be
passed on to another user.

Programs written in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Version 3 will be capable of being speeded up in
operation by the use of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3 compiler. This is designed to produce
programs which are executable without the need for supporting code, i.e. they
are true stand-alone .PRG files which can be distributed freely by the author.
Our only request is that an acknowledgement that they were produced using GFA
BASIC be included.

Any program that uses <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a><a href="#()">()</a> directly will run much better on all TOS

One other thing that is worth noting. You can completely avoid GFA's built in
error handling if you access <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a><a href="#()">()</a> directly for all your file I/O needs. I
recommend all file I/O be done through direct <a href="#GEMDOS">GEMDOS</a><a href="#()">()</a> calls.  This will also
allow you to trap any file errors yourself rather than rely on the error
handling built into <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<a name="Getting_Started"></a><b><a href="#Getting_Started">Getting Started</a></b>

This section describes how to convert a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 source listing into an
executable program, and is intended for those readers who want to try out the
compiler quickly.

Before you continue you should take a backup copy of your original disk.

To generate a program you need the following files:

    GFA_BCOM.PRG  <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Compiler
    GL.PRG        <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Linker
    GFA3BLIB      Linker library
    GFA3BLIB.NDX  Linker library <a href="#index">index</a> file
    <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>.PRG      Menu program for the GFA system
    <a href="#*">*</a>.GFA         <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 source files
    GFABASIC.PRG  <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Interpreter
    RCS2.PRG      Resource Construction Set required if your program will
                  support RCS files

To quickly compile one of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> source files (<a href="#*">*</a>.GFA) into a program
which can run without the Interpreter, do the following:

1) Start the <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>.PRG program.

2) In the File menu choose the entry entitled Select.

3) In the File Select box specify the GFA file to be compiled.

4) Press the F10 key. The source program will then be compiled and linked.

5) The compiled and linked code is now in the file called TEST.PRG on the
   diskette. You can execute it either by using the TEST entry in the File
   menu, or by exiting the menu program and running TEST.PRG

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Function_of_the_Compiler">The Function of the Compiler</h2>
The Computer cannot understand BASIC commands directly. A BASIC program,
therefore needs to be translated into a language the computer understands. The
Interpreter reads the program line by line, translates each line into machine
code and then executes the machine code.

This method has advantages and disadvantages. The two most important
disadvantages are:

1) The program needs the Interpreter to run.

2) Since each BASIC command must be first translated before it can be executed,
   running programs can be relatively slow.

<a href="#The_Compiler">The Compiler</a> is a program which converts all the BASIC source code into machine
code without executing the resulting code. The compiled program can then be
saved.

<a href="#The_Compiler">The Compiler</a>, therefore, assembles an executable program from the individual
BASIC commands. This program then runs independently of the Interpreter and
Compiler. Program execution is fast because the commands are already in
translated format, ie machine code.

The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> Compiler described in this book can only compile programs written
in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> version 3.x. These programs must be stored using the <a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a> command
in the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Interpreter. <a href="#The_Compiler">The Compiler</a> will not work with any program
stored using the <a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a>,A command, nor will it compile <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> version 2.0
programs, or any other versions of BASIC.

Earlier versions of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> interpreter may be incompatible with later
versions of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> compiler. If in doubt, use the latest versions.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Commands_Not_Accepted_by_the_Compiler">Commands Not Accepted by the Compiler</h2>
There are some commands which the Compiler will not accept; for example, the
commands such as <a href="#TRON">TRON</a>, <a href="#TROFF">TROFF</a>, and <a href="#TRACE$">TRACE$</a>, commands which affect the output
listing.

The <a href="#DEFLIST">DEFLIST</a> command is ignored by the Compiler, and the <a href="#DUMP">DUMP</a> command will not
be accepted, since the compiled program does not recognize variables by name.

As you cannot load, save, or list a compiled program, the <a href="#LOAD">LOAD</a>, <a href="#SAVE">SAVE</a>, <a href="#PSAVE">PSAVE</a>,
<a href="#LIST">LIST</a>, and <a href="#LLIST">LLIST</a> commands cannot be executed from a compiled program.

<b>Memo:</b> The command <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#==&gt;">==&gt;</a>' is also not accepted by the compiler.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Interpreter_-_Compiler_Differences">Interpreter - Compiler Differences</h2>
The <a href="#CHAIN">CHAIN</a> command works differently depending on whether it is interpreted or
compiled. In a compiled program the specified name is given to the <a href="#AES">AES</a> function
<a href="#SHEL_WRITE">SHEL_WRITE</a><a href="#()">()</a>, and the program which is running is terminated with a <a href="#QUIT">QUIT</a>
command. The program called by the <a href="#CHAIN">CHAIN</a> command is then started.

The called program does not therefore take up any more space.

A command line up to 128 bytes can be passed to the chained program. The
command line should be placed at <a href="#BASEPAGE">BASEPAGE</a>+128.

At least 32500 bytes must be free for a compiled program before calling the
<a href="#FILESELECT">FILESELECT</a> command.

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#STOP">STOP</a> returns error code -128.

      The editor always intializes the <a href="#AES">AES</a> and the <a href="#VDI">VDI</a>, however the compiler
      will only do this if some <a href="#AES">AES</a> or <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> call is made. It's possible the
      ID returned from <a href="#APPL_INIT">APPL_INIT</a><a href="#()">()</a> is invalid, or the handle from <a href="#V~H">V~H</a> is
      invalid. Simply making an <a href="#AES">AES</a> or <a href="#VDI">VDI</a> call will force the compiler to
      link the initialization code.

      Also <a href="#~">~</a><a href="#INP">INP</a>(2) will appear to fail under MiNT if the <a href="#AES">AES</a> is not
      initialized.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Using_the_Menu_Shell_Program">Using the Menu Shell Program</h2>
The menu program enables programs to be called up easily, and parameters to be
passed to these programs. When a program executed from the menu program has
finished, the user is returned to the menu program.

The menu shell program for the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 Compiler resides on the
distribution disk, and enables you to call the Interpreter, Compiler, Linker,
and Resource Construction Set, implement Compiler and Linker options.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_File_Menu">The File Menu</h2>
The first entry in the drop down File menu is Select. When this entry is
chosen, a File Select box appears for you to enter the GFA file on which you
want to work. As with all the other commands, you can also make this selection
using keys; the <b>Select</b> menu entry can also be activated up using
<b>Control and S</b><a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#The_Compiler">The Compiler</a> menu entry sends the file selected to the Compiler, which will
create an object file called TEST.O. The <b>Compiler</b> can also be activated
using <b>Control and C</b><a href="#.">.</a>

The next menu entry can be used to call the Interpreter. The file assigned is
the one given in the Select entry. The <b>Interpreter</b> function can also be
activated using <b>Control and I</b><a href="#.">.</a>

The <b>Linker</b> entry can be selected using <b>Control and L</b>, to create
an executable program called TEST.PRG from the file TEST.O created by the
Compiler.

The <b>RCS</b> entry will call the RCS2.PRG. An alternative program name can
be placed in the variable <b>gfarcs$</b><a href="#.">.</a> The RCS function can also be
activated by <b>Control and R</b><a href="#.">.</a>

Selecting the <b>Test</b> entry, or <b>Control and T</b>, will initiate the
execution of the program TEST.PRG.

The <b>Execute</b> entry. The Execute function can also be activated by
<b>Control and X</b><a href="#.">.</a> An external program can be run from this command. The
file selection will appear, requesting you to enter the program to be executed.

The F10 key, calls the Compiler and then the Linker, and is thus a short cut
for <b>Control and C</b> and then <b>Control and L</b><a href="#.">.</a>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Options_Menu">The Options Menu</h2>
The next drop down menu gives the Compiler and Linker options. These are
described fully in sections 2.0 and 3.0.

The options are listed in the following table, with their respective menu entry
and key combination used to control the option:

    <b>Entry       Keys to activate  Option</b>
    Interrupts  Alternate+I       I+
    Select      Alternate+S       S&amp; or S&lt; or both
    Functions   Alternate+F       F&lt;
    Procedures  Alternate+P       P&gt;
    IntDiv      Alternate+<a href="#/">/</a>       %3
    IntMul      Alternate+<a href="#*">*</a>       *&amp;
    Error       Alternate+E       E$
    Memory      Alternate+M       mxxxx
    DebugSym    Alternate+D       <a href="#-s">-s</a>
    TT          Alternate+T       T

You can activate or suspend the options by using the keys or by selecting the
menu entry. With the Memory option you are asked for the amount of storage
space required by the program.

All these options, with the exception of DebugSym, are concerned with the
Compiler. The table entry for Select shows several possibilities of two
options. Selecting the menu entry once specifies the first option, selecting
the entry a second time specifies the second option, selecting the entry a
third time specifies both options.

The selected options are displayed on the top left of the screen. While the
Compiler is active the Basic line number being compiled is displayed in the
drop down menu list.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="The_Sets_Menu">The Sets Menu</h2>
<a name="G3LIB"></a><a name="G3OBJ"></a><a name="G3PRG"></a><a name="G3MOVE"></a><a name="G3WAIT"></a>In the last menu, entitled Sets, certain parameters can be set. These
parameters are described below.

The <b><a href="#G3WAIT">G3WAIT</a></b> parameter determines whether or not, during compilation and
linking, a key is to be pressed before a file is opened. Such files could be
for example, the program being compiled, the object file, GFA3BLIB.NDX,
GFA3BLIB and the PRG file.

The purpose of this option is to allow you to change the disk before pressing
the key to continue. This is essential if you have only one disk drive, and the
necessary files reside on more than one disk.

After selecting this option, all the parameters in the Sets menu are displayed
on the screen. From this display you can see whether <a href="#G3WAIT">G3WAIT</a> has been turned on
or off.

You can also see from this display whether the next parameter on the menu,
<b><a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a></b>, is on or off. If G3MOVE is on, G3MOVE=ON is displayed on the
screen.

Enabling <a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a> directs the Compiler to manage the available storage space
economically during compilation. To begin the task the source code is loaded,
and compilation started. The compiled code is also held in store until it is
moved out.

In the case where you have a very large program and only a small amount of free
space, the source code and object program together may be too large to fit
completely in memory.

By activating <a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a>, as each procedure is compiled the source code is moved
out of memory. Naturally, this packing of memory during compilation is time
consuming, so <a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a> should only be enabled when necessary.

If you only select the entry <b><a href="#G3OBJ">G3OBJ</a></b>, you can change the default name of
the object file (normally TEST.O). Similarly, using <b><a href="#G3PRG">G3PRG</a></b> you can
change the default name of the compiled and linked object program (normally
TEST.PRG).

<b><a href="#G3LIB">G3LIB</a></b> enables you to change the name of the library normally called
GFA3BLIB. These options can, of course, be used not only for naming the
individual files, but also for establishing the path to the files.

The parameters can also be called by typing the letter following G3.

<b>PRG=GFA</b>, also selected with <b>F2</b> key. In this mode the file name
given to the compiled code is derived from the .GFA file (rather than be called
TEST.PRG). By selecting F2 (or by setting auto&amp; in the <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>.PRG to 1), a GFA
file can be quickly selected and compiled with the sequence:

    <b>F2</b>
    <b>CTRL S</b> (entering name in File Select box)
    <b>F10</b>

<b>C Object</b>, also selected with <b>C</b> key. With this option you can
enter the names of the object files to be linked to the compiled code (Turbo C,
<a href="#DR">DR</a> C, or assembler)<a href="#.">.</a>

Therefore:

    W or w  for  <a href="#G3WAIT">G3WAIT</a>
    M or m  for  <a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a>
    O or o  for  <a href="#G3OBJ">G3OBJ</a>
    P or p  for  <a href="#G3PRG">G3PRG</a>
    L or l  for  <a href="#G3LIB">G3LIB</a>
    F2      for  PRG=GFA
    C       for  C Object

Pressing the <b><a href="#Help">Help</a></b> key clears the screen and displays the current state
of the Sets menu parameter entries.

Pressing the <b>Undo</b> key clears the screen but does not display the

You can find a listing of the shell on your disk. In the listing you can set
the parameters described in the previous section. You will find the following
lines in the first part of the listing:

    gfaints$<a href="#=">=</a>"GFABASIC.PRG"
    gfacom$<a href="#=">=</a>"GFA_BCOM.PRG"
    gfalnk$<a href="#=">=</a>"GL.PRG"

These define the names of the interpreter, compiler, and linker and can, of
course, be altered.

The parameters <a href="#G3OBJ">G3OBJ</a>, <a href="#G3PRG">G3PRG</a>, and <a href="#G3LIB">G3LIB</a> take their default values from the
following lines:

    tobj$<a href="#=">=</a>"<a href="#G3OBJ">G3OBJ</a>=TEST.O"

    tlib$<a href="#=">=</a>"<a href="#G3LIB">G3LIB</a>=GFA3BLIB"

The parameters <a href="#G3WAIT">G3WAIT</a> and <a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a> get their values from these lines in the shell

    t_wait$<a href="#=">=</a>"<a href="#G3WAIT">G3WAIT</a>=ON"
    t_move$<a href="#=">=</a>"<a href="#G3MOVE">G3MOVE</a>=ON"

You can enable these options by deleting the underscore character in the

define the the default compiler and linker options.

The line <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> irq%,&amp;HD6 contains an interrupt routine which during
compilation displays the number of the currently compiled line. Should you wish
to save the shell as a LST file, the <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> section needs to be saved
separately (go to <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> line, press <a href="#Help">Help</a> and save.  See a full explanation of
<a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> in the Basic Interpreter manual)<a href="#.">.</a>

The following line:

    {irq%+2}=V:a&amp;

declares a 16-bit variable to be displayed in the interrupt.

The lines:

    <a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{irq%+6}=32+35
    <a href="#BYTE">BYTE</a>{irq%+7}=32+10

define column 35 as the X position for the text output of the interrupt routine
and column 10 as the Y position.

When examining the shell program on the disk, you may notice that no redraw
routine has been implemented. This makes the program shorter and saves memory
space (shells ought to be small)<a href="#.">.</a> The primary reason for this, however, is to
keep visible the screen contents left behind by a program which has just been
run by the menu item "Test"<a href="#.">.</a>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Using_with_DOS_Shells">Using with DOS Shells</h2>
The compiler and linker may be controlled not only by the Shell, but also by a
DOS shell (command line interpreter)<a href="#.">.</a> This section describes the use of a DOS
shell or similar interface.

The compiler parameters can be passed in the same form as they appear in the
shells screen display, i.e.

    gfa_bcom name S&amp; %3

Much the same applies to the linker parameters. Linking with generation of a
symbol table is achieved by

    gl <a href="#-s">-s</a>

To include a file named c_tst,

    gl c_tst

may be entered.

In this example, test.o, c_tst.o and gfa3blib are linked. The <a href="##">#</a> character in
the parameter list prevents the file test.o being linked.

The line

    gl <a href="##">#</a> c c_tst

would link the files c.o, c_tst.o and gfa3blib, but not test.o. In order to use
a library other than gfa3blib, you can enter its name prefixed with a plus
sign. Thus

    gl +new_lib

ensures that test.o and new_lib are linked. The linker considers all parameters
which are not prefixed by a plus sign and are not <a href="#-s">-s</a> or <a href="##">#</a> as the names of
object files to be linked.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Program_Return_Value">Program Return Value</h2>
After every program call, the return value is ouput on the screen. A 0 return
is OK, a negative number denotes an error (eg File not found), and a positive
number indicates other error conditions. Thus for example, the compiler could
return the number of uncompiled instructions and the linker the number of
undefined symbols.

<b>Memo:</b> Error codes are as follows:

      Compiler values:
      &lt;0 <a href="#=">=</a> Gemdos error code unless otherwise noted

<a name="Array_Index_Checking"></a><b><a href="#Array_Index_Checking">Array Index Checking</a></b>

If you wish to use arrays in your program, these have to be dimensioned with
<a href="#DIM">DIM</a><a href="#.">.</a> This involves specifying the size of the largest array <a href="#index">index</a>. During
execution of the program, the GFA-BASIC Interpreter will check your array <a href="#index">index</a>
value for legality. If found too high, error 16 (Array <a href="#index">index</a> too large) is
reported. This also applies to the compiler for <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 2.0.

There is no such array <a href="#index">index</a> checking in programs generated with the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
3.0 compiler. If an illegal large value appears for the array <a href="#index">index</a>, there is
no error message. The absence of this check makes programs shorter and quicker.

The following example shows the effect of there being no array <a href="#index">index</a> checking.
The program writes the numbers 0 to 5 to the screen. The interpreter generates
the error message "Array <a href="#index">index</a> too large"<a href="#.">.</a> The error message is triggered
because the dimensioning has limited the maximum <a href="#index">index</a> size to 5, yet the <a href="#FOR">FOR</a>
loop attempts to address an array element x(6)<a href="#.">.</a>

    <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> x(5)
    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i=0 TO 6
      x(i)=i
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> x(i)
    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i

When you compile and run this program, it writes the numbers from 0 to 6 to the
screen and no error message appears. The program acts as if the array x() in
the first line had been dimensioned to a sufficient size. You cannot tell from
the behaviour of the compiled program that it contains a serious mistake.

The example raises the question of what the compiled program would do if the
array <a href="#index">index</a> were too large. The <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> command reserves memory space for the
specified number of array elements. Without the programmer noticing this, the
array <a href="#index">index</a> is used in order to calculate the addresses of the array elements.

Compiled programs will do this even where the array <a href="#index">index</a> is too large. The
address calculated is outside the memory area reserved for the array. If the
array <a href="#index">index</a> is too large therefore, data outside the area reserved for the
array will be overwritten.

Normally the RAM space thus overwritten will contain data which is essential
for the error-free execution of the remaining program. If this data is
overwritten, the program can generate errors or even crash.

So far we have described the disadvantages of the absence of array <a href="#index">index</a>
checking. An excessively large <a href="#index">index</a>, however, will not figure in a finished
program since the programmer will have hopefully eliminated such mistakes. The
interpreter used for program development has supported him in this by its array
<a href="#index">index</a> checking.

Index checking is therefore unnecessary in the compiled program. It requires
time and space. The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 compiler is about four to five times as fast
as the Basic 2.0 compiler in simple operations with array elements (allocation,
addition of two array elements etc) and ten to twelve times as fast as the
Basic 3.0 interpreter.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Integer_Overflow">Integer Overflow</h2>
When changing integer variables, the GFA BASIC interpreter checks that the
value of the variable lies within the range for this variable type. The legal
ranges for the three types of integer variables are:

    <b>Type  Postfix  Minimum      Maximum</b>
    Byte  <a href="#|">|</a>        0            255
    Word  &amp;        -32768       32767
    Long  <a href="#%">%</a>        -2147483648  2147483647

When the legal range is exceeded, error numbers (depending on the type of
variable affected) 2, 3 or 4 are triggered (Number not integer, byte, or word)<a href="#.">.</a>
Such an error is known as integer overflow.

A program generated with the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 compiler will not always be checked
for integer overflow. Such a check is superfluous in an error-free program and
only requires time and space. It is only sensible during program development
with the interpreter.

The program:

    x&amp;=10000
    y&amp;=4*x&amp;
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> y&amp;

generates the error message "Number not word" in the interpreter, whereas the
compiled program writes -25536 to the screen with no error message.

From the first two lines of the program, the compiler will generate the
following code (without the comments, of course)<a href="#:">:</a>

    move.w  <a href="##">#</a>$2710,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)  <a href="#;">;</a>$2710 is 10000 decimal
                               <a href="#;">;</a>$8000(a5) is the address of x&amp;,
                               ;the instruction therefore equals
                               ;the line x&amp;=10000.
    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),d0      ;x&amp; is written into data
                               ;register 0.
    asl.w   <a href="##">#</a>$2,d0             ;The multiplication with a power
                               ;of 2 (4 in this case) is
                               ;executed with a fast bit shifting
                               ;command.
    move.w  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5)      <a href="#;">;</a>-$7ffe(a5) is the address of

                               ;y&amp;<a href="#.">.</a>

The advantage of the non-existing integer overflow check results in the high
speed of the code. A program with a <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> loop and simple additions and
subtractions of integer variables is faster than in the interpreter by a factor
of 26.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Integer_Division">Integer Division</h2>
<a name="$%0"></a><a name="$%3"></a>The compiler options <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> and <a href="#$%3">$%3</a> influence the division of integer variables
(longwords)<a href="#.">.</a> If the <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> option is active, the variables to be divided are made
into floating point variables and then divided. The result of such a division
is a floating point variable.

If the <a href="#$%3">$%3</a> option is enabled, the two integer variables are not made into
floating point variables. The result of the integer division will then be
interpreted as an integer value.

Example: Once compiled, the program

    <a href="#$%0">$%0</a>
    x%=5
    y%=2
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> x%/y%

produces the output 2.5. The fact that the digit behind the decimal point was
output indicates that x% and y% have been converted into floating point numbers
before the division took place. Compiler option <a href="#$%3">$%3</a> will produce 2 as a result,
since x% and y% are interpreted as integers without decimal points and
therefore only an integer division is carried out. This option has no effect in
the interpreter, of course, where you will get 2.5 in both cases.

The code generated by the two options will illustrate the difference once
again.

The lines

    <a href="#$%0">$%0</a>
    a%=x%/y%/z%

will generate the code:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0

    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.w  d2,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.w  d1,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d0
    bsr     FITOF
    move.w  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d4
    move.w  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d5
    move.l  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d3

    bsr     FXDIV
    bsr     FFTOI
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

In this listing, you will notice that the subroutine FLTOF (integer to float),
which converts the integers into floating point numbers, is called three times.
Since the result is returned to an integer variable, the routine FFTOI (float
to integer) is also required. The division is carried out with (FXDIV), a
division routine producing floating point results.

By contrast, the program

    <a href="#$%3">$%3</a>
    a%=x%/y%/z%

generates the assembler listing

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d1
    bsr     LDIV
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff4(a5),d0
    bsr     LDIV
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000

This short listing simply calls a fairly straight forward subroutine to divide
two longwords (LDIV) and can therefore be processed much faster than under the
<a href="#$%0">$%0</a> option. The difference in speed is of a factor around 10 to 11.

If two integer variables are divided and the result is returned to an integer
variable without any further processing, the compiler option %0 is of no
consequence. In that case, only pure integer arithmetic is being used.

In the event of two-byte variables being defined, the Motorola 68000
processor's div command is used instead of the LDIV routine (see the section on
division in the Program Optimisation chapter)<a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Memo:</b> <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> is the default.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Integer_Multiplication">Integer Multiplication</h2>
<a name="$*&amp;"></a><a name="$*%"></a>The <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a> option influences the multiplication of two integer variables, of which
at least one is a four-byte variable. Normally in such cases a subroutine to
multiply two four-byte variables is called. If the <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a> option is enabled,
however, the Motorola 68000 processor's muls instruction is used instead.

This has two consequences:

1. Program execution is speeded up.

2. The muls instruction multiplies two two-byte values and produces a four-byte
   value as the result. Therefore, if the four-byte variables to be multiplied
   contain values in excess of the range of a two-byte variable, the use of
   only two bytes will generate a different result from when option <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a> is not
   enabled.

Example: The lines

    <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a>
    b%=40000
    c%=10
    a%=b%*c%
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a%

will produce the expected result of 400000 in the interpreter. The compiled
program, however, outputs -255360 because only two bytes of b% have been used,
and these two bytes cannot represent as large a value as 40000.

The difference is once again illustrated by the code generated from the line
a%=b%*c% with and without option <a href="#$">$</a>*&amp;<a href="#:">:</a>

    <b>with <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a>                 with <a href="#$*%">$*%</a>, without <a href="#$">$</a><a href="#*">*</a>&amp;</b>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Reserving_Memory_Space">Reserving Memory Space</h2>
<a name="$M"></a>The compiler option $Mx is used to generate a program which will simply reserve
x bytes for itself. Normally a program generated with the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0
compiler claims all available memory space (minus 16 kb) for itself.

The instruction <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> can be used to force a program to claim only part of
the free memory, but this has an effect different from the $mx option. A
program beginning with <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> 25600, for example, will first claim all free
memory when run. The GFA BASIC instruction <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> will only then be executed
and release some of the reserved space again.

By contrast, the compiler option $m25600 will ensure that not all free memory,
but only 25600 bytes (if available) will be used by the program. This compiler
option must be used in <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> which may only use part of the free memory.
You can find an example in the chapter on <a href="#accessories">accessories</a><a href="#.">.</a>

<b>Memo:</b> The space between the option and the number is optional.
      Example: $m 2048
      The compiler does not actually accept values in the range of 0 to 999.
      Any value in this range is automatically replaced with 1000.
      Odd values are rounded down (made even)<a href="#:">:</a> $M65535 <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> allocates 65534 kb

      Important: If the exact value cannot be allocated (ram to low) it
      gives the application all the available ram minus 16384 bytes. This
      could cause a program to behave strangely or crash, since the program
      doesn't know it was given a smaller amount than requested.
      This situation can be detected with the following code:
      <a href="#IF">IF</a> <a href="#MALLOC">MALLOC</a>(<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a>)<a href="#&lt;">&lt;</a>=16384
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> "<a href="#$M">$M</a> failed, program terminated!"
        <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>
      <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>

      Under MiNT memory is rounded to an 8kb boundary, so you might as well
      request a size pre-rounded up, this way your program can use the ram
      that would normally be wasted.

      What exactly is contained in this block of memory:
      Dimensioned arrays (all types)<a href="#:">:</a> <a href="#DIM">DIM</a> tmp$(10),buf|(32),ptr%(12)
        This also includes all data stored in the array and its <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a>
      All assigned strings: t$<a href="#=">=</a>"test"
        This also includes the string <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a><a href="#.">.</a>

      This can be a very tricky value to compute! It may requires some trial
      and error.

      What is not in this block of memory?
      All assigned numerical variables (all types)<a href="#:">:</a> a#=3.16 or size%=2048
        These are stored in the BSS section of the binary.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Return_Value_of_a_Function">Return Value of a Function</h2>
<a name="$F%"></a>The <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> option must be entered as the first line of a function to have an
effect. It instructs the compiler to output the return value of the function
as an integer. The default output is a floating point value.

This default behavior is probably some throw back to the classic days of BASIC
where everything was floating point. Unless you care about it yourself at each
and every function, you will always get the slower floating point.

<a href="#$F%">$F%</a> does not specifically imply long% type only. The compiler actually checks
the variable at <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#RETURN_x">RETURN x</a>' and adjusts the code automatically based on the
variable type. In other words the compiler will auto cast it to the correct
integer type. String functions are handled automatically and <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> is ignored.

To be more precise, the <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#%">%</a>' (percent sign) means return any integer type, it
does not mean return only long type. The compiler does not report syntax
errors within compiler commands, it simply ignores them.

Not only does this speed up your functions but it reduces the code size of
each function. Option <a href="#$F%">$F%</a> eliminates two library calls, BSR FITOF (integer to
float) and BSR FFTOI (float to integer)<a href="#.">.</a> Both of these add several lines of
needless assembler overhead to each function call made!  Quite literally if
<a href="#$F%">$F%</a> is missing the function converts the output to floating point and then the
assignment to some variable converts it back. The effect of this at each call
of a function is, integer <a href="#-">-</a><a href="#&gt;">&gt;</a> float -&gt; integer, which is for sure not very
optimal.

<b>Memo:</b> The compiler requires this command to be on the very 1st line of the
      funcition or it has no effect at all. Example:

      a%<a href="#=">=</a>@test             !BSR FFTOI (flt to int)
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> a%
      <a href="#EDIT">EDIT</a>
      <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> test
        <a href="#$F%">$F%</a>                !absolutely has to be the very 1st line!
        <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> 1.23456789  !BSR FITOF (int to flt)
      <a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

      A space between <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$">$</a>' and 'F%' will cause it to fail. Example:
      <a href="#$">$</a> F%  !compiler fails to see the option

      According to some French manuals $F| and $F&amp; are valid options.
      These do not work, in fact it will result in a float being returned!
      I've also seen $F$ and $F! in other peoples source listings and they
      do not work.

      To be precise, no where in the compiler source code is a check for
      $F!, $F!, $F&amp;, or $F$<a href="#.">.</a> All of these produce slower floating point
      output. The compiler has exactly one check for <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$F%">$F%</a>' only. Any books
      or manuals that state otherwise are incorrect.

      <a href="#DEFFN">DEFFN</a> functions always return floating point values.
      They must be recoded into multi-line functions to speed them up.

<a name="$RC&amp;"></a><a name="$RC%"></a>The compiler options <a href="#$RC&amp;">$RC&amp;</a> and <a href="#$RC%">$RC%</a> are used to control the interpretation of
the <a href="#RC_INTERSECT">RC_INTERSECT</a><a href="#()">()</a> parameters. By default, these parameters are converted by
the compiler into four-byte parameters.

In many cases, however, the range of two-byte integer variables is quite
sufficient for these parameters. Using option <a href="#$RC&amp;">$RC&amp;</a>, you can make the compiler
interpret the <a href="#RC_INTERSECT">RC_INTERSECT</a><a href="#()">()</a> parameters as two-byte parameters.

This option is important only exceptionally and in special cases. The
<a href="#RC_INTERSECT">RC_INTERSECT</a><a href="#()">()</a> function is principally intended for calculating the size of
overlapping rectangles within a redraw.

For a redraw, only two-byte parameters are required since coordinates can only
be two bytes large under GEM. But the speed gain through using the <a href="#$RC&amp;">$RC&amp;</a> option
can be neglected here because, on the one hand, other instructions (such as the
screen section renewal) within a redraw take more time than the window overlap
calculation, and on the other, the <a href="#RC_INTERSECT">RC_INTERSECT</a><a href="#()">()</a> function will only be called
a few times in such a case.

However, the <a href="#$RC&amp;">$RC&amp;</a> option does save some memory space when using 16 bit
variables. Another application can be found in the context of hidden line
calculations.

<a name="$X"></a>The <a href="#$X">$X</a> name must be the first line in a procedure or function. In this event,
the contents of the procedure or function is not compiled, but a message is
left for the linker to instruct it to take the routine "name" from an object
file to be linked in.

The use of this option is explained in the section
"<a href="#Linking_C_Functions_without_C_Libraries">Linking C Functions without C Libraries</a>"<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#*">*</a>* The manual ends here, the following is what I found to be true. **

Parameters are always passed on the stack.
Only words and longs will be passed.
Floats are a special case and passed as two longs.
In order to use floats in assembler one would need to know GFA's internal
float format.
Bytes and boolean values are cast into words.
Strings and <a href="#VAR">VAR</a> parameters are cast as long pointers.
In the case of strings or arrays, the address of the <a href="#descriptor">descriptor</a> is passed.
The assembler routine receives the parameters in the reverse order starting at
offset 4(sp)<a href="#.">.</a>

Example call:
  @test(long1%,long2%,long3%)

In assembler:
  move.l   4(sp),d3  ;long3%
  move.l   8(sp),d2  ;long2%
  move.l  12(sp),d1  ;long1%

Your routines should always end with an RTS instruction.

The assembler routine should not alter the stack, because GFA itself removes
the parameters from the stack after the call for you. If you do need to alter
the stack, be sure to save and restore it.

Also registers a3 to a6 should not be altered. However you can use these so
long as you save and restore them.

When coding functions, d0 is always used to return a long value.
<a href="#$F%">$F%</a> is automatically implied.

<b>Memo:</b> The space between the option and the name can be left out.
      Example: $Xname
      A space between <a href="#'">'</a><a href="#$">$</a>' and 'X' will cause it to fail.
      Example: <a href="#$">$</a> Xname !compiler fails to see the option
      <a href="#$X">$X</a> contains a serious bug: It does not fix the stack correctly after
                                 the call in all cases.
      It only works correctly for PROCEDURES that do not use <a href="#VAR">VAR</a><a href="#.">.</a>
      With <a href="#VAR">VAR</a> it calculates too small of a stack correction.
      With <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> it does no stack correction at all!
      The problem is the parameters are actually left on the stack.
      Thus each call eats stack space, until eventually the stack collides with
      GFA's internal structures.

      Devpac v3.1 can be used to build DRI format object files.
      Registers a3 to a7 must remain unchanged.

The scanning of the break keys is linked to a test for the <a href="#EVERY">EVERY</a> and <a href="#AFTER">AFTER</a>
conditions. Also, a RESUME/NEXT is prepared.  Therefore all instructions which
could generate errors should be enclosed by $u (or, to put it more accurately,

<a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a> and <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> treat all values as four-byte parameters.

A look at the resulting code illustrates the differences. The listing

Each marker is followed by an instruction (<a href="#INC">INC</a> a%) as a placemarker for the
individual instruction blocks.

Use of the <a href="#$S&amp;">$S&amp;</a> option results in the following code:

The L1 label is not generated here.

The listing first places the four-byte value a% into d0. Then the routine to
branch to the individual <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> instruction blocks is called. This is marked in
the listing by the comment "<a href="#CASE">CASE</a> evaluation"<a href="#.">.</a> There cmpi.w (compare integer
words) is used to compare, for wordlength only, the values after <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> with the
contents of d0.

If these values are found to be identical, beq.s (branch equal) jumps to the
block after the appropriate <a href="#CASE">CASE</a><a href="#.">.</a> This block ends with the jump to the line
behind the <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a> block. Here the jump is made using bra.s _ENDSEL.
If none of the values after <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> fits, the <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> block is called. Without the
S&amp; option the comparisons made here would be for longword length.

      Whilst viewing a diss-assembly of the GFA Compiler I discovered a check
      for the <a href="#$S|">$S|</a> command.  However, my tests seem to indicate that it's
      identical to the <a href="#$S&amp;">$S&amp;</a> command. The reason is simple, there is no size or
      speed advantage to byte comparisons on the 68000. The <a href="#$S|">$S|</a> command seems
      to have been added just for completeness.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="SELECT-CASE_Optimisation">SELECT-CASE Optimisation</h2>
<a name="$S&gt;"></a><a name="$S&lt;"></a>The <a href="#$S&gt;">$S&gt;</a> and <a href="#$S&lt;">$S&lt;</a> options determine the optimising criterion for the <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#CASE">CASE</a>
instructions. <a href="#$S&gt;">$S&gt;</a> leads to optimisation by execution time, <a href="#$S&lt;">$S&lt;</a> according to
program length.

You have seen in the last section how, at the end of the program blocks after
the <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> and the <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> instructions, bra.s branches into the line following
<a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a><a href="#.">.</a> However, if the program blocks are longer than in the last section,
where they only contained an addq, bra must be used instead of bra.s.

The space required for the specification of the jump distance is larger with
bra than with bra.s. The <a href="#$S&lt;">$S&lt;</a> option can be used to save this space. It results
in the bra instruction at the end of a <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> block to be directed to the bra
instruction of the next block (after the next <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> or <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a>), as long as the
jump distance is small enough.

This could result in a chain of short branch jumps which finally ends behind
<a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a><a href="#.">.</a> This chain of jumps from bra.s to bra.s may again be altered by the
compiler at a later stage of optimisation.

This not altogether straight forward problem is clarified by the following
listing:

              move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),d0
              bra     L1
    _CASE_1:  addq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)
              bra.s   L0
    _CASE_2:  addq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)
    L0:       bra     L2
    _DEFAULT: addq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)
              <a href="#.">.</a>..
              Many instructions
              <a href="#.">.</a>..
    L2:       bra.s   _ENDSEL
    L1:       cmpi.w  <a href="##">#</a>$1,d0 <a href="#;">;</a><a href="#CASE">CASE</a> evaluation
              beq     _CASE_1
              cmpi.w  <a href="##">#</a>$2,d0
              beq     _CASE_2
              bra     _DEFAULT
    _ENDSEL   addq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

The crucial point here is the line bra.s L0. This branch should really go to
behind <a href="#ENDSELECT">ENDSELECT</a><a href="#.">.</a> But the distance would be too far for a bra.s because of the
many instructions in the <a href="#DEFAULT">DEFAULT</a> block. Hence the branch is to the bra command
in the next <a href="#CASE">CASE</a> program block.

While this method is executed more slowly, it requires less space than the code
generated with <a href="#$S&gt;">$S&gt;</a>, which does without such jumps.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Symbol_Table">Symbol Table</h2>
<a name="-s"></a>The <a href="#-s">-s</a> option tells the linker to append a symbol table so that the program can
be disassembled and debugged using symbols. The names of the procedures and
functions as well as label names are taken from the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> listing and
written as symbols.

Only the first seven characters of a procedure, function or label name are used
in this process, and are prefixed with an underscore character.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Library_Selection">Library Selection</h2>
The +lib option selects the library lib_name to be used by the linker. If this
option is not enabled, the linker will look for a library under the name
GFA3BLIB.

The section headed "<a href="#Linking_with_C_Libraries">Linking with C Libraries</a>" describes in more detail how a
library is created or how GFA3BLIB can be extended. In that section you are
shown how to include the Turbo C libraries.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Linking_Object_Files">Linking Object Files</h2>
To link an object file, which must be <a href="#DR">DR</a> format, you can pass the file name
without the .O extender to the linker.

The section "<a href="#Linking_C_Functions_without_C_Libraries">Linking C Functions without C Libraries</a>" will describe in more
detail how you can use the routines contained in the object files in your
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programs.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Do_not_Link_TEST.O">Do not Link TEST.O</h2>
Using the <a href="##">#</a> parameter, the linker can be made not to link the TEST.O file. By
default, the linker looks for a file of that name, since the compiler gives
this name to all object files created by it.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Run_in_TT_Ram">Run in TT Ram</h2>

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Including_C_Functions">Including C Functions</h2>
<a name="cdecl"></a>This section deals with the question of how routines written in the C
programming language can be included in compiled <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 programs. The
method described here requires the C compiler to be able to generate object
files in the <a href="#DR">DR</a> format, as can DR C and Turbo C.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Linking_C_Functions_without_C_Libraries">Linking C Functions without C Libraries</h2>
The basic method will now be demonstrated with the aid of an example. The
routine to be included is to fill the elements of a two-byte array with numbers
from 0 to n, passing the address and the size of the array. The parameter
passed for the array size will only be a two-byte variable so that the size of
the array is limited to 32267 elements. The function carrying out this task
will work without the use of library functions.

The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program is to be written in such a way that it can also be run by
the interpreter. In the interpreter, of course, the C routine cannot be
included through the linker. Therefore it is made executable within the
interpreter by a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> routine taking over the task of the C routine to be
linked.

The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program looks like this:

    DlM x&amp;(32000),y&amp;(32000)
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    t1%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#TIMER">TIMER</a>
    f_gfa(32000)

      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> y&amp;(i&amp;),
    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i&amp;
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> f_gfa(n&amp;)
      <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i&amp;=0 TO n&amp;
        x&amp;(i&amp;)=i&amp;
      <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i&amp;
    <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> f_c(adr%,n&amp;)
      <a href="#$X">$X</a> fill
      i&amp;=0
      a%=adr%
      <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> i&amp;<a href="#&lt;">&lt;</a>=n&amp;
        <a href="#WORD">WORD</a>{a%}=i&amp;
        <a href="#INC">INC</a> i&amp;
        <a href="#ADD">ADD</a> a%,2
      <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>
    <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

First, two arrays are dimensioned. Then two timings are taken: the first calls
the f_gfa routine which assigns values of 0 to 32000 to the elements of the
array x&amp;<a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a> For display purposes, the first 40 elements of the array are then
displayed on screen.

The second of the timings calls the routine f_c. This routine, too, is to
assign values of 0 to 32000 to an array, but this task is to be performed in
the compiled and linked program by a C routine. Therefore this routine is
supplied with the field address and the number of values to be written.

In the first line of the procedure f_c you will find an instruction which tells
the linker to include the C function "fill"<a href="#.">.</a> The name of the function can be
found after the <a href="#$X">$X</a> option. This line must always be the first line of the
procedure.

The linker replaces the contents of the procedure with the C routine named
after <a href="#$X">$X</a><a href="#.">.</a> In the interpreter, this line is ignored and the command lines
following <a href="#$X">$X</a> c_routine are executed. There are three of these in the given
example, which perform the same function as the C routine and also work in the
same way as the C routine by carrying out value assignments through a pointer.

Now to the structure of the C program carrying out the assignment. It was
written in Turbo C and reads:

    void <a href="#cdecl">cdecl</a> fill(n,adr)
    int n;
    int *adr;
    {
      int i; int *a;
      a <a href="#=">=</a> adr;
      for( i=0 <a href="#;">;</a> i&lt;=n ; *a++ = i++ );
    }

The first line contains the name of the function which appears after <a href="#$X">$X</a> in the
GFA-Baisc listing. This function has no return value and has therefore been
declared as void.

Before the function name there is the instruction <a href="#cdecl">cdecl</a><a href="#.">.</a> It tells Turbo C to
receive the parameters via the stack. Some other C compilers, such as <a href="#DR">DR</a> C, do
this automatically. In the GFA BASIC listing the parameters are passed in the
order adr%, n&amp;<a href="#.">.</a>

C takes the parameters from the stack in the reverse order, i.e. first the
two-byte value n and then the address of a four-byte variable adr. The
following lines then carry out the assignment of values to the field elements.

This completes the description of the structure of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> and the C
listings. It only remains to explain how you can get the linker to insert the C
function in the position of <a href="#$X">$X</a> fill. To do this, you only need to specify the
name of the object file generated by the C compiler.

This file name can simply be entered in the command line if a DOS shell is
used. In the shell supplied the variable <a href="#G3OBJ">G3OBJ</a> can be amended.

The execution time of the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> loop is around 0.51 seconds, while the
Turbo C loop only requires about 0.115 seconds. This shows how assignments
using pointer operations can be effectively optimised in Turbo C.

Thus the following steps have to be followed:

1. You write a procedure in the GFA BASlC program, the first line of which
   contains the <a href="#$X">$X</a> option followed by a C function name.

2. You write a C program containing this function. This must take the
   parameters and place them on the stack. There the parameters are placed in
   the reverse of the order that they have when passed by the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
   program.

3. When linking, the object file of the C listing with the routine to be linked
   must be specified.

If the <a href="#DR">DR</a> C compiler is used, one point to be noted is that this compiler
prefixes C function names with the underscore character. Hence, instead of <a href="#$X">$X</a>
fill, <a href="#$X">$X</a> _fill would have to be entered.

In our example, the C function had no return value and was therefore declared
as void. However, a C function can be employed not only in place of a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
procedure, but also in place of a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> function.

The appropriate <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> listing could be, for example:

    value%=100
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> @doub(value%)
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#FUNCTION">FUNCTION</a> doub(a%)
      <a href="#$X">$X</a> double
      <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a> 1,"Place marker for|a C function.",1,"Return",a&amp;
      <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a> 0
    <a href="#ENDFUNC">ENDFUNC</a>

In this example, the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> function does not perform the task of the C
routine to be linked in. The simple C programs follows:

    long <a href="#cdecl">cdecl</a> double(x)
    long x;
    {
      return x+x;
    }

The return value of such an external function is always an integer value.

You can, of course, also link assembler routines. These must take their
parameters from the stack and must not change the stack pointer SP or the
registers A3, A4, A5 and A6.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Linking_with_C_Libraries">Linking with C Libraries</h2>
In the C routines used so far only C keywords have been used, but no library
routines. If, for example, you wanted to use a printf in one of the C routines,
you would have to link the appropriate routine from the libraries.

This can be done by extending the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> compiler's library. The following
small program enables you to integrate the Turbo C libraries into the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>
compiler's library. Your C routines can then contain all the C instructions
from the libraries. The program reads likes this:

    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "O",#2,"NEW_LIB"
    <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "I",#1,"GFA3BLIB"
    l%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#LOF">LOF</a>(#1)
    <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> l%&gt;32000
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #2,<a href="#INPUT$">INPUT$</a>(32000,#1)<a href="#;">;</a>
      <a href="#SUB">SUB</a> l%,32000
    <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>
    <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #2,<a href="#INPUT$">INPUT$</a>(l%,#1)<a href="#;">;</a>
    <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #1
    @append("TCSTDLIB.LIB")
    @append("TCEXTLIB.LIB")
    @append("TCGEMLIB.LIB")
    @append("TCTOSLIB.LIB")
    @append("TCFLTLIB.LIB")
    <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #2
    <a href="#'">'</a>
    <a href="#PROCEDURE">PROCEDURE</a> append(lib$)
      <a href="#RELSEEK">RELSEEK</a> #2,-2
      <a href="#OPEN">OPEN</a> "I",#1,lib$
      l%<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#LOF">LOF</a>(#1)-2
      <a href="#SEEK">SEEK</a> #1,2
      <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> l%&gt;32000
        <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #2,<a href="#INPUT$">INPUT$</a>(32000,#1)<a href="#;">;</a>
        <a href="#SUB">SUB</a> l%,32000
      <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>
      <a href="#PRINT">PRINT</a> #2,<a href="#INPUT$">INPUT$</a>(l%,#1)<a href="#;">;</a>
      <a href="#CLOSE">CLOSE</a> #1
    <a href="#RETURN">RETURN</a>

To use this program, you may have to change the path name of the files. To use
the new library, you will require the appropriate <a href="#index">index</a> files (NDX files),
which can be generated with the library manager of the GFA-Assembler, for
instance, or similar programs (DOINDEX)<a href="#.">.</a>

As soon as both files are created, you can use all instructions from the Turbo
C libraries in the C routines to be linked. You simply need to tell the GFA
BASIC linker that you wish to use the new library and not GFA3BLIB. This is
done with the +lib_name linker option if you are using a DOS shell (in our
example, +NEW_LIB)<a href="#.">.</a>

The linker may, under certain circumstances, report back that it does not
recognise the variable errno. C compilers do not take this from the libraries
as it is part of the startup code.

One precondition for the trouble-free use of the new library is that the Turbo
C and the GFA3BLIB libraries do not contain any functions which exist under the
same name in both libraries. We do not know of any such function in the present
version of Turbo C.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Some_Peculiarities">Some Peculiarities</h2>
In larger programs it is generally necessary to avoid using PC-related calls.
In Turbo C, this can be avoided with the -P compiler option.

The C routines must not alter the registers A3 to A6, or expect particular
values from them. Turbo C and <a href="#DR">DR</a> C conform with this requirement, but Megamax
C, for example, does not. C programs have about 4 kb available for the stack.

<b>Memo:</b> The following was taken from the amiga version of the manual:

You may require an assembler interface like:

name:    movem.l a3-a6,regsave
         jsr     c_name
         movem.l regsave,a3-a6
         rts

regsave: ds.l    4

You may then need to employ an extra dummy parameter in your C routine, to
mask the return address of 'jsr c_name'<a href="#.">.</a> For example:

name (long x, long y)
c_name(long dummy, long x, long y)

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Linker_Error_Messages">Linker Error Messages</h2>
The GL linker outputs some brief error messages:

    ?xxxxxxxx  means unknown symbol xxxxxxxx
    +xxxxxxxx  means symbol redefinition
    &gt;xxxxxxxx  means 16 bit offset too large

<b>Memo:</b> The linker will only report a bad symbol if the procedure or
      function is actually called.
<hr size="3"><h2 id="Programming_Accessories">Programming Accessories</h2>
<a name="The_Structure_of_Accessories"></a><a name="accessory"></a><a name="accessories"></a><b>The structure of <a href="#accessories">accessories</a></b>

An <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> is a program which is installed in RAM after power-on or a reset.
There it waits until it receives an instruction to become active. This
instruction is sent when the user has selected it, usually from the GEM Desktop
menu.

From this simple description you can figure out the rough structure of an
<a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a> First we said that an accessory had to be installed. To this end,
the programmer must declare the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> as a GEM application and pass its
name to GEM so that it can be entered as an item in the first of the dropdown
menus.

Declaration as a GEM application is performed with the <a href="#APPL_INIT">APPL_INIT</a><a href="#()">()</a> function,
the return value of which is known as the applications ID.

The value returned by <a href="#APPL_INIT">APPL_INIT</a><a href="#()">()</a> can also be used to determine whether a
program was started as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> or as a normal program. If the return value
is 0, the program was not started as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>, but as a normal program. You
can thus write programs in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 which are executable both as normal
programs and as <a href="#accessories">accessories</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The applications ID number is also required for passing the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> name.
This is done with <a href="#MENU_REGISTER">MENU_REGISTER</a>(ap_id,text$)<a href="#.">.</a>

<a href="#MENU_REGISTER">MENU_REGISTER</a><a href="#()">()</a> returns the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> number of the current program (0 to 5)<a href="#.">.</a>
This value is called the menu identification number. A return value of -1 means
that 6 <a href="#accessories">accessories</a> have already been installed, the maximum for GEM, and
therefore there is no room for another one. The two parameters are the
application ID and the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> name.

Now the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> has been installed, the next step consists of waiting for it
to be called. An <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> must be programmed as an endless loop within which
the message buffer is scanned.

This scanning can be done, for instance, with the <a href="#EVNT_MESAG">EVNT_MESAG</a><a href="#()">()</a> function. If a 0
is passed to this function, it will write messages coming from GEM into
<a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a>'s own message buffer which can then be read using <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1) to MENU(8)<a href="#.">.</a>

The most important message type for an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> is <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1)=40 (AC_OPEN)<a href="#.">.</a> This
message means that the user has selected an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a> If, however, the
<a href="#accessory">accessory</a> runs in a window, the other messages relating to the selection of
other elements and to the redraw are also of interest.

An <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> normally offers the user the option to remove it again from the
screen. In terms of the program's internal structure this means that the
<a href="#accessory">accessory</a> must return to the endless loop by means of the <a href="#EVNT_MESAG">EVNT_MESAG</a>(10)
instruction. There must be no <a href="#END">END</a> or a similar command in an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> because
that would make the computer "hang"<a href="#.">.</a>

This description needs one further point to be added. <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programs
attempt to claim all free memory space for themselves after they have been
started. You can, of course, release space again with <a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a>, but before the
<a href="#RESERVE">RESERVE</a> command is executed the initialisation routine of a compiled program
will already have performed the reservation of memory space.

To prevent this, a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> must include a line which tells the
compiler that the program to be generated must not claim all the free memory.
This is what the compiler option $mx does, with x being the number of bytes to
be claimed by the compiled program.

The screen area occupied by an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> must be restored. This is called
redraw. If, for example, you are using dialog boxes, this redraw can be
performed from within your <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>, using <a href="#GET">GET</a> and <a href="#PUT">PUT</a> to read in the screen
area and then writing it back again.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Programming_Example">Programming Example</h2>
After this dry run we will now look at an example of an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> program. A
particularly brief example:

    $m1000
    ap_id&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#APPL_INIT">APPL_INIT</a><a href="#()">()</a>
    <a href="#IF">IF</a> ap_id&amp;=0
      <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a> 1,"I am not|an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> now.",1,"Return",a&amp;
      <a href="#END">END</a>
    <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>
    me_id&amp;<a href="#=">=</a><a href="#MENU_REGISTER">MENU_REGISTER</a>(ap_id&amp;,"  Colour switch ")
    <a href="#DO">DO</a>
      <a href="#~">~</a><a href="#EVNT_MESAG">EVNT_MESAG</a>(0)
      <a href="#IF">IF</a> <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1)=40
        <a href="#ALERT">ALERT</a> 1,"Color switch",1,"bw|wb",a&amp;
        <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> 0,a&amp;
      <a href="#ENDIF">ENDIF</a>
    <a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a>

In the first line, the program reserves for itself 1000 bytes of storage space.
Then it announces itself as a GEM application and obtains an application ID
which it puts into the variable ap_id&amp;<a href="#.">.</a> If ap_id&amp; equals 0, the program was not
started as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a> It displays a message to this effect and terminates
itself.

The line with <a href="#MENU_REGISTER">MENU_REGISTER</a><a href="#()">()</a> passes the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>'s name to GEM and obtains a
menu ID number me_id&amp;<a href="#.">.</a> Then follows an endless loop scanning the message buffer
with <a href="#EVNT_MESAG">EVNT_MESAG</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a>

When the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> receives the message that it has been called (<a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1)=40),
it activates itself. In this example, however, the action is rather minimal.
The <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> lets you invert the screen with <a href="#SETCOLOR">SETCOLOR</a> and then returns to its
endless Loop.

If more than one <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> exists, it will be necessary to determine which has
been selected. <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(5) holds the ID of the selected <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Longer_Programming_Examples">Longer Programming Examples</h2>
This section will introduce two examples of <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> programming. They do not
perform any meaningful activity but serve illustration purposes only. The first
example program generates a window with a randomly selected fill pattern as its
contents. It runs both as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> and as a program. The other example
appears as a dialog box with radio buttons, an edit field and buttons.

First to the window program: it first reserves 5120 bytes for itself and then
obtains its application ID. Then it checks if its ID is 0. A value of 0 would
mean that it had be started as a program and not as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a>

If started as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>, it now enters its name into the menu. Then it
branches to an endless loop consisting of only two instructions. The first
being <a href="#EVNT_MESAG">EVNT_MESAG</a><a href="#()">()</a>, which waits for events. The 0 parameter ensures that
messages can be evaluated with the aid of <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1) to MENU(8)<a href="#.">.</a> The second
instruction calls the sub-procedure message which reacts to any messages
received.

If not started as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>, the program opens a window and defines a
routine for message evaluation. This routine is identical to the one performing
the task of message evaluation in the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> version. The <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop
will now wait for events until the procedure message sets the variable exit! to
<a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a><a href="#.">.</a>

The procedure message is almost identical in structure to a normal window
management routine in a normal program. It first reads the coordinates of the
current window into the variables x&amp;, y&amp;, b&amp;, and h&amp;<a href="#.">.</a>

The <a href="#SELECT">SELECT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#CASE">CASE</a> instruction branches according to the different possible
messages received by <a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1)<a href="#.">.</a> The first such message is also the most
important: the redraw message.

As soon as this message is received, the <a href="#AES">AES</a> is informed about the imminent
screen redraw with <a href="#WIND_UPDATE">WIND_UPDATE</a>(1)<a href="#.">.</a> We now go through the rectangles list of the
window in which the redraws take place.

Each rectangle is drawn in a random fill pattern. Unless two adjacent
rectangles happen to be drawn in identical fill patterns by chance, you can
examine the way GEM manages the rectangles list. For redrawing the rectangles
it would, strictly speaking, be sufficient to draw the rectangle only in the
area affected by a clipping.

But the method followed is the same as in a conventional window program. The
clipping is imposed on the rectangle to be drawn and the entire working area of
the window is redrawn. In your own program, you would have to replace the <a href="#PBOX">PBOX</a>
command with a routine to draw the window contents.

The remaining messages can be dealt with by only a few instructions. In the
example, commands specific to GFA BASIC, such as <a href="#TOPW">TOPW</a>, <a href="#FULLW">FULLW</a> etc., are
generally used. At the WM_CLOSED message, in addition to <a href="#CLOSEW">CLOSEW</a>, the variable
exit! is set to <a href="#TRUE">TRUE</a><a href="#.">.</a> This is to cover the possibility of the program not
running as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a>

This routine differs from a normal window management routine by its ability to
react to the message AC_OPEN. This message reports that the user has selected
the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a> As a result, the window is opened.

The areas over written by the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> must be redrawn by the program from
which the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> was called. The task of sending an appropriate redraw
message to that program is performed by GEM and need not be considered in this
listing.

Now to the next sample program in which a dialog box is used. This program
reserves quite a lot of memory space for itself to begin with, almost 13kb.
This space is required primarily to save, with <a href="#GET">GET</a>, the screen area covered by
the dialog box.

In the window program, GEM sent out a redraw message when the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> window
was closed. If the dialog boxes of an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> are to disappear from the
screen and the old contents of the area restored, another method has to be
chosen.

One possibility is to trigger the redraw message for the screen area affected.
For this purpose, there exists the <a href="#FORM_DIAL">FORM_DIAL</a>(3,<a href="#.">.</a>..) routine. Another
possibility is illustrated by the program following. It is possible to read in
the screen area covered by the dialog box with <a href="#GET">GET</a>, and then to restore it
later with <a href="#PUT">PUT</a><a href="#.">.</a>

Using <a href="#FORM_DIAL">FORM_DIAL</a><a href="#()">()</a> requires less memory space. However, the program that is to
perform the redraw may need some time for this task. Using <a href="#GET">GET</a> and <a href="#PUT">PUT</a> is
considerably faster.

This program, by the way, also calls an alert box. The screen area covered is
automatically redrawn by GEM. GEM uses a similar method for this as the one
chosen in our program with <a href="#GET">GET</a> and <a href="#PUT">PUT</a><a href="#.">.</a> The area covered by the alert box,
therefore, does not have to be redrawn by the BASIC program since GEM will be
doing it.

After determining the application ID the program checks if it has been started
as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a><a href="#.">.</a> If not, it wiil terminate itself. In contrast to the
previously discussed window demo, this demo will therefore run as an <a href="#accessory">accessory</a>
oniy.

Next the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> attempts to load in its resource file. If it cannot find
this, it must not be terminated like a normal program because it wouid then get
into an endless loop with an EVNT instruction.

If the resource file has been found, the program assigns object numbers to the
dialog box variables. This part of the program consists of the LST file written
by the Resource Construction Set. Once this is done, the address of the dialog
box tree is obtained and a default text assigned to the editable field.

Only now is the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> entered into the menu. In the following loop, it
waits to be called via (<a href="#MENU">MENU</a>(1)=40)<a href="#.">.</a> As soon as this call arrives, the
dimensions of the dialog box are calculated and the corresponding screen area,
with a additional safety margin, is saved. The dialog box can now be drawn and
managed with <a href="#FORM_DO">FORM_DO</a><a href="#()">()</a><a href="#.">.</a>

On quitting the dialog box, the exit object is reset to its previous state and
the screen area overwritten by the box restored with <a href="#PUT">PUT</a><a href="#.">.</a>

In the following lines, the information entered into the dialog box by the
user, is read and displayed in an alert box. Then the <a href="#accessory">accessory</a> returns to the
endless loop, where it awaits its next call.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Program_Optimization">Program Optimization</h2>
The <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 compiler generates assembler code. You can support it in this
task by appropriate programming. In this chapter we shall consider, the
question of what a GFA BASIC program should look like in order to make the
resulting compiled program as fast and short as possible. To achieve this, you
have to know how the compiler goes about its optimization.

This chapter contains some assembler listings representing compiler generated
code. If you wish to disassemble programs generated by the compiler yourself,
you should let the linker append the symbol table to the code. The compiled
program always begins with the lines:

STARTADR:  lea.l  STARTADR-256(pc),a0
           lea.l  $100(a0),a7
           jsr    INIT

These three lines are followed by the code in the first lines of your BASIC
program. The end of this code is marked by the label BaseA4. When linking with
the symbol table enabled, the names of procedures and functions are inserted as
symbols (underline character plus name)<a href="#.">.</a>

You will be able to benefit from this chapter even if you have no knowledge of
assembler, by taking note of the advice derived from the listings <a href="#-">-</a> although
you may not, in this case, understand why a certain program formulation is more
efficient than another one.

The knowledge of assembler required to understand the disassembled listings has
been kept to a minimum. This chapter is aimed at <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programmers wishing
to familiarise themselves with assembler in order to, for example, write
speed-critical subroutines in that language.

We cannot, of course, discuss all the instructions understood by the compiler,
but can only pick out a few examples of particular importance from the point of
view of optimization.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Simple_Additions">Simple Additions</h2>
The Atari ST's processor, the Motorola 68000, has instructions to process
integer numbers. BASIC lines which simply carry out arithmetic operations on
integer variables can be translated into a few assembler instructions as long
as these lines are not too complex.

Operations on floating point variables require far more assembler instructions,
and this is reflected in the processing time taken. Adding two integer values
to each other is about five to six times faster than the addition of two
floating point values.

The first question to be discussed here is: When does the compiler use the
faster integer arithmetic and when does use floating point arithmetic?

The statements a%=b%+c% and a%=<a href="#ADD">ADD</a>(b%,c%) are processed by the interpreter at
different speeds. The compiler, however, simply generates the same code from
both:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d0
    add.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

The addresses <a href="#-">-</a>$xxxx(a5) depend on which variables are used in the program.
The variables can be found from <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5) onwards.

If you have used two-byte variables, for instance a&amp;=b&amp;+c&amp;, the compiler will
generate the following instructions:

    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    add.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0
    move.w  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

With one-byte variables (a|=b|+x|) you get:

    moveq.l <a href="##">#</a>$0,d0
    move.b  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0
    move.b  <a href="#-">-</a>$7fff(a5),d1
    add.l   d1,d0
    move.b  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

However, a program line such as a=b+c uses floating-point variables. To perform
a floating point addition, the compiler program will contain an appropriate
subroutine. In the disassembled listing of a program with a symbol table you
find:

    lea.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff0(a5),a0
    lea.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),a1
    bsr     VVFADD
    lea.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),a0
    move.l  d0,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>
    move.w  d1,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>
    move.w  d2,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>

This listing contains the line bsr VVFADD. This line branches to the floating
point addition routine, which is processed far more slowly than the
instructions generated by, for example, a%=b%+c%<a href="#.">.</a>

The code produced by two-byte additions can be processed most quickly by the
computer. The next fastest is the one-byte addition code, then the four-byte
addition and finally, a long way behind, the floating point addition code.

The following table gives some examples for the different timings for the
different variable types in a simple addition in both the interpreter and the
compiler. A loop with 5000 runs was used, with the time taken by the loop
commands eliminated.

    <b>Type   Interpreter  Compiler  Statement</b>
    Byte   11.715       0.31      a|=b|+c|
    Word   11.715       0.255     a&amp;=b&amp;+c&amp;
    Long   11.355       0.335     a%=b%+c%
    Float  6.23         1.925     a=b+c

Similar timings apply to subtraction.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Multiplication">Multiplication</h2>
The optimization used by the compiler with multiplication contains a special
feature. The Atari ST's processor does have multiplication instructions, but it
requires a large number of tact cycles for their execution and only knows these
instructions for two-byte values. Therefore the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0 compiler has to
coordinate the multiplication of a constant with a four-byte variable while
avoiding the use of the assembler instructions mulu and muls.

The line

    x%=y%*4

for example, can be simply translated into the code:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),d0
    lsl.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2,d0
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)

since 4 is the square of 2. Coding the statement:

    x%=y%*21

is somewhat more involved, since 21 equals binary 10101. To be able to better
understand the code generated by the compiler, let us assume in the comments
that y%=100. The code generated is:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),d0  ;y%, that is 100, into register d0
    move.l  d0,d2          ;copy of y% into register d2
    lsl.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2,d0         ;d0 times 4, d0 contains 400, d2=100
    add.l   d0,d2          ;add 400 to 100, therefore d0=400,
                           ;d2=500
    lsl.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2,d0         ;d0 times 4, therefore d0=1600,
                           ;d2=500
    add.l   d2,d0          ;add d2 to d0: d0=2100, d2=500
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)  ;writes result 2100 to x%

This code uses an extra 6 bytes of memory compared to a muls <a href="##">#</a>$15,d0 (which,
however, does not exist for four-byte values), but is faster with 52 tact
cycles execution time (without the first and the last move instruction)<a href="#.">.</a>

By contrast, the statement

    x&amp;=y&amp;*21

was coded using muls. In the case of 100,000 multiplications with 21,
therefore, the four-byte variables statement is a little faster:

    <b>Statement  Time</b>
    x%=y%*21   0.975
    x&amp;=y&amp;*21   1.08

However, if the multiplication is not with 21 but with values whose translation
into the assembler statements add, sub, lsl and asl requires relatively lengthy
code, the four-bytes variant not only generates considerably more code, but
also executes more slowly than the two-bytes statement working with muls. For
example, multiplying with 21845 (binary 101010101010101) instead of 21, the
execution times for 100,000 repeats are:

    <b>Statement    Time</b>
    x%=y%*21845  2.26
    x&amp;=y&amp;*21845  1.34

So far we have only looked at multiplications of one variable with one
constant. When multiplying two integer variables, however, the fact that the
mul statement only processes two-bytes values is also of great importance.

The following list shows the code generated by different integer
multiplications and their execution times for 25000 multiplications.

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff4(a5),d0  ;x%=y%*z%, 7.685
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d1
    bsr     LMUL
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)
    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff0(a5),d0  ;x%=y%*z&amp;, 6.165
    ext.l   d0
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d1
    bsr     LMUL
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)
    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff0(a5),d0  ;x%=y&amp;*z&amp;, 2.44
    muls    <a href="#-">-</a>$7fee(a5),d0
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)
    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff0(a5),d0  ;x&amp;=y&amp;*z&amp;, 2.315
    muls    <a href="#-">-</a>$7fee(a5),d0
    move.w  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7fec(a5)

The great speed differences between the first and the last two stems from the
fact that in the last two examples, muls could be used instead of the LMUL
routine. The absolute timings also depend on the values found in y%, z%, y&amp;,
and z&amp;<a href="#.">.</a> The relative speeds between the different statements, however, remain
broadly the same.

In these two cases, where a four-bytes variable is involved, the <a href="#$*&amp;">$*&amp;</a> compiler
option can also force a use of muls. It has to be remembered, however, that
only two bytes of the four-byte values processed enter into the calculation. A
more detailed description can be found in the chapter on compiler options
(integer multiplication)<a href="#.">.</a>

The small differences between the two LMUL and the two muls examples stem from
the move.w versus move.l and the ext.l instructions only. When multiplying
integer variables, it is therefore worthwhile using two-byte instead of
four-byte variables.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Division">Division</h2>
Divisions of integer variables can produce decimal points, for instance x%=5,
y%=2, x%/y%=2.5. In contrast to multiplication, the compiler would therefore
have to perform division generally as floating point division. This is indeed
what it does, as long as the programmer does not expressly tell it to perform
the division of two integer variables as an integer division with an integer
result.

You can do this by using the compiler option <a href="#$%3">$%3</a>, (the complement <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> option),
which causes every division to be performed as a floating point division, is
the default. You can see the difference by analysing the code produced by the
line

    x=y%/z%

Using the default <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> option, this produces:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d0
    bsr     FITOF
    move.l  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.w  d2,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.w  d1,<a href="#-">-</a>(a7)
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff4(a5),d0
    bsr     FITOF
    move.w  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d4
    move.w  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d5
    move.l  (a7)<a href="#+">+</a>,d3
    bsr     FXDIV
    lea.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),a0
    move.l  d0,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>
    move.w  d1,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>
    move.w  d2,(a0)<a href="#+">+</a>

You can see that the two variables to be divided are transformed into floating
point variables using the FITOF (integer to float) routine. The routine for the
division of two floating point values is called (FXDIV) and the result assigned
to the variable x from <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)<a href="#.">.</a>

If the same line is compiled using the <a href="#$%3">$%3</a> option, the following code results:

    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    move.l  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5),d1
    bsr     LDIV
    lea.l   <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),a0
    bsr     ISTOF

The ISTOF routine performs the assignment to x. Here the LDIV routine for the
division of two long-integer variables is called. If the two values are such
that decimal places are the result of the division, LDIV will not, of course,
return these.

If the line were to read x%=y%/z% instead of, as is the case here, x=y%/z%,
this would be of no consequence as the result would be returned to an integer
variable. In such a case, the GFA BASIC compiler automatically uses LDIV for
the division, even with <a href="#$%0">$%0</a> enabled.

If two two-byte variables are to be divided, the Motorola 68000 processor's div
instruction can be used, which is of course faster than the LDIV routine. The
code, in this case, is particularly simple and fast.

The line

    x&amp;=y&amp;/z&amp;

produces:

    move.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0
    ext.l   d0
    divs    <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    move.w  d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

The conclusion: If at all possible, use two-byte variables for a division and
enable the <a href="#$%3">$%3</a> option if you are sure that no integer variables which would
produce significant decimal places are being processed.

When dividing by constants, the optimization carried out are similar to those
with multiplications. For example, the division by a value to the power of two
is converted into bit-shift instructions.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="More_Complicated_Calculations">More Complicated Calculations</h2>
So far we have only considered arithmetic operations on two variables. Now we
must look at operations involving more than two variables. The compiler can
only translate such operations into code which does not contain branches to
subroutines up to a certain level of complexity. The following example will
illustrate this.

To execute the program line

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>(y&amp;*y&amp;-y&amp;)/y&amp;+z&amp;

fifty thousand times, a compiled program (without the loop commands) requires
about 2.56 seconds. But this line can also be broken up into

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>(y&amp;*y&amp;-y&amp;)/y&amp;
    x&amp;=x&amp;+z&amp;

These two lines perform the same task, from the point of view of the result, as
the first statement. However, the compiled program requires only about 1.875
seconds for the execution of these lines. The rule that can be derived from
this is: Break up lines containing more complicated integer calculations into
several lines.

To understand why the two-line variant executes faster than its one-line
equivalent, we must analyze the corresponding section from the (symbolically)
disassembled program.

The line

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>(y&amp;*y&amp;-y&amp;)/y&amp;+z&amp;

is translated into

    move.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0
    muls     <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0  ;y&amp;*y&amp;
    movea.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),a0
    sub.l    a0,d0          <a href="#;">;</a>-y&amp;
    move.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d1
    ext.l    d1
    bsr      LDIV           ;/y&amp;
    movea.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5),a0
    add.l    a0,d0          <a href="#;">;</a>+x&amp;
    add.w    <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0  <a href="#;">;</a>+z&amp;
    move.w   d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)

The addresses of the variables once again depend on the order of their
introduction into the program. Here, for example, the variable x&amp; was
introduced first, y&amp; second, and z&amp; third. Thus their addresses are

    x&amp;  <a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)
    y&amp;  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5)
    z&amp;  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5)

In the listing you will find the line bsr LDIV, calling a subroutine for the
division of two integer values. If you now compare this listing with the
two-line version, you will find that the latter contains no subroutine call.
The statements

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>(y&amp;*y&amp;-y&amp;)/y&amp;
    x&amp;=x&amp;+z&amp;

produces the code:

    move.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0
    muls     <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d0  ;y&amp;*y&amp;
    movea.w  <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),a0
    sub.l    a0,d0          <a href="#;">;</a>-y&amp;
    move.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffe(a5),d1
    divs     d1,d0          ;/y&amp;
    add.w    d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)  ;End of first line
    move.w   <a href="#-">-</a>$7ffc(a5),d0
    add.w    d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)  <a href="#;">;</a>+z&amp;

As you can see, this listing is a few instructions shorter than the previous
one and contains no subroutine calls using bsr (branch subroutine)<a href="#.">.</a> The code
will become even more efficient, by the way, if you use reverse Polish notation
with <a href="#ADD">ADD</a> x&amp;,<a href="#.">.</a>.. instead of x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>...  In the interpreter, the one-line variant
is faster than the two lines. But if you wish to tailor your programs to the
compiler, you should present it with relatively short integer arithmetic
statements only, which it will best be able to code into assembler
instructions.

Brackets are often inserted into calculations for reasons of clarity, although
strictly speaking they are superfluous. Thus instead of

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>(y&amp;*y&amp;-y&amp;)/y&amp;

you could use the line

    x&amp;=x&amp;<a href="#+">+</a>((y&amp;*y&amp;)-y&amp;)/y&amp;

We are not concerned here with the clarity of the example. You will find that
in the interpreter, the version with the additionai pair of brackets is slower.
In the compiled program, however, both versions are equally fast since the same
code is generated from them.

So if you want to insert brackets to improve intelligibility, you can do this
without a speed penalty in the compiled program as long as the brackets have no
influence on the result of the calculation.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Loop_Commands">Loop Commands</h2>
The best-known program optimization in <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 2.0 was that the <a href="#FOR">FOR</a>-<a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop
in the 2.0 interpreter and the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop in the 2.0 compiler were the
fastest. It is different with the compiler for <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> 3.0.

If an empty loop is run 5000 times through the three loop types <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>,
<a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> and <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>-<a href="#WEND">WEND</a>, the following timings are obtained with a
four-byte variable:

                  <b><a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a>  <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>-<a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>  <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a>-<a href="#WEND">WEND</a></b>
    <b>Interpreter</b>   3.76      14.765        16.42
    <b>Compiler</b>      0.77      0.77          0.77

The <a href="#DO">DO</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a> loop with EXlT <a href="#IF">IF</a> and the derivatives of DO-LOOP, such as DO-LOOP
<a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>, will not be considered here, other than observing that the <a href="#DO">DO</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#LOOP">LOOP</a> loop
with EXlT <a href="#IF">IF</a> is slower in the compiler (0.875).

As can be seen from the table, the three loop types are all equally fast in the
compiled program. Thus it is no longer sensible to "adapt" a program to the
compiler by altering all loops to <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loops.

The equal execution times may suggest that the code generated by the three
loops must be very similar. This is correct, as the disassembled listings of
the three loop types will now show. We have inserted the statement b%=10 into
each loop in order to make the position of the loop contents recognisable in
the code.

The <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop

    <a href="#FOR">FOR</a> i%=1 TO 10000
      b%=10
    <a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> i%

generates the following listing (the jump addresses and the variable addresses
are again only examples)<a href="#:">:</a>

    moveq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$1,d0             ;Loop starts at 1
    move.l   d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)      ;Assign start value to i%
L1: moveq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$a,d0             ;Assign the value of 10
    move.l   d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)      ;to the variable b%
    addq.l   <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)     ;Increment i% by 1
    cmpi.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2710,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)  ;End of loop reached?
    ble.s    L1                 ;If not, go back

The first two instructions define the loop start value i%<a href="#.">.</a> Then follows the
loop contents, here from label L1 in which the value of 10 is assigned to the
variable b% using two instructions.

After that, the variable i% is incremented by 1 and this is followed by
checking whether the loop end value has been reached. The end value was 10000,
that is hex $2710. If the loop counter variable is still smaller than or equal
to this value, the loop must be executed again.

If the end value of a loop is defined not by a constant but by, for instance, a
variable, it will of course have a different structure, as will a loop using
<a href="#STEP">STEP</a><a href="#.">.</a>

Since the addq follows after the loop contents and the exit condition is tested
only after that, i% will equal 10001 on completion of the loop. It is a
convention in the BASlC language that the counter variable of a <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop
is greater than the loop's end value on exit from the loop. This is because the
exit condition of the loop has been met if the counter is greater than the end
value.

However, when translating your programs into other BASIC dialects or other
languages, you should not rely on this BASIC convention being adhered to.

Now to the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop. The BASIC lines

    i%=0
    <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>
      <a href="#INC">INC</a> i%
      b%=10
    <a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> i%=10000

translate into the following assembler instructions:

    clr.l    <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)         ;i%=0.
L1: addq.l   <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)     ;Increment i% by 1
    moveq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$a,d0             ;Set b% to the
    move.l   d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)      ;value of 10
    cmpi.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2710,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)  ;Compare 10000 with i%
    bne.s    L1                 ;If i% not equal 10000

In this listing, the instruction clr.l is only executed once, all other
instructions several times. In the listing of the <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop, the same
instructions are executed several times as in the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop: an addq,
a moveq, a cmpi and a branch instruction with a logical condition.

The same execution times for the <a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> and the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a>-<a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loops thus
become understandable. In the <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WEND">WEND</a> loop it is also the same instructions
which are executed several times. The lines

    i%=0
    <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a> i%&lt;10000
      <a href="#INC">INC</a> i%
      b%=10
    <a href="#WEND">WEND</a>

compile into the assembler code:

    clr.l    <a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)         ;i%=0
    bra.s    L2                 ;Jump to cmpi
L1: addq.l   <a href="##">#</a>$1,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)     <a href="#;">;</a><a href="#INC">INC</a> i%
    moveq.l  <a href="##">#</a>$a,d0             ;set b% to the
    move.l   d0,<a href="#-">-</a>$8000(a5)      ;value of 10
L2: cmpi.l   <a href="##">#</a>$2710,<a href="#-">-</a>$7ff8(a5)  ;Compare 10000 with i%
    blt.s    L1                 ;If i% smaller, go back

The compilation of the <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WEND">WEND</a> loop into assembler differs from the
<a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a> loop in two respects.

1. The logical condition has been formulated differently, in the <a href="#REPEAT">REPEAT</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#UNTIL">UNTIL</a>
   loop it is an exit condition and in the <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WEND">WEND</a> loop it is a
   "continuation condition"<a href="#.">.</a>

2. The <a href="#WHILE">WHILE</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#WEND">WEND</a> loop is a descending loop. Its condition is therefore tested
   before the first execution of the loop interior. For this reason, the
   assembler program first jumps to the loop condition test with a bra
   instruction.

In all other respects the implementation of the two loop types is identical.
The identical timings for all loop types enable you as the <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> programmer
to choose your loop types exclusively from the point of view of program
structure rather than having to choose a less well suited loop for reasons of
execution speed.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Character_Strings">Character Strings</h2>
In this section we are not discussing speed optimization but the shortening of
the program. If, in a <a href="#GFA-Basic">GFA-Basic</a> program, a string variable is assigned a
character string, as for instance a$<a href="#=">=</a>"Test", the compiler places this character
string into the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment of the program generated.

The compiler attempts to keep the initialised strings section short. When a
character string is assigned to a string variable, the compiler will first
search the already existing character string section to see if the new string
is already present there. If this is the case, it will remember the string's
address.

Example: Suppose you want to translate a program into several languages and you
therefore place all text output into a procedure in the BASIC program in order
to simplify the translation. There you will now find the lines

    a$<a href="#=">=</a>"escape key"
    b$<a href="#=">=</a>"terminate the program"
    x$<a href="#=">=</a>"the escape key will terminate the program"

During symbolic linking, the DATASTAR symbol will be inserted into the DATA
segment of the program to mark the beginning of the string section. There our
three character strings can be found one immediately after the other.

You can change the order of the three lines to

    x$<a href="#=">=</a>"the escape key will terminate the program"
    a$<a href="#=">=</a>"escape key"
    b$<a href="#=">=</a>"terminate the program"

Now you will only find the string "the escape key will terminate the program"
after DATASTAR. The reason is this: First the compiler puts the long text line
into the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment. Then it is asked to initialize a string containing the
text "escape key"<a href="#.">.</a>

To this end, it searched the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment and found the text "escape key" as a
component of the long text line, noting its position in the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment
without storing it again. The same happened with the text "terminate the
program"<a href="#.">.</a>

If the long line is listed as the last one of the three, as in the first
version, the compiler will only find fragments of this line in the <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment
when initialising the long line. In that event, it will store the complete
string.

With a character string which is also contained in another one, the longer
string must first be assigned to a variable to enable the compiler to optimize
the use of memory space.

Strings in <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> lines are, incidentally, placed after DATASTAR before all
strings assigned to a variable. The <a href="#DATA">DATA</a> segment itself begins with a table of
local variables (VARTAB)<a href="#.">.</a> Then follows the 48-bytes long TYPETAB, if TYPE or an
assignment using a pointer (e.g. *x=3 or <a href="#SWAP">SWAP</a> *x,x%<a href="#()">()</a>) have been used.

After VARTAB, or TYPETAB if required, there are the <a href="#INLINE">INLINE</a> areas. Only then
follows the DATASTAR symbol, behind which the contents of DATA lines and the
initialised strings can be found.

<hr size="3"><h2 id="Local_and_Global_Variables">Local and Global Variables</h2>
In the 3.0 interpreter, operations involving local and global variables are
executed at the same speed. This is different with compiled programs. An empty
<a href="#FOR">FOR</a><a href="#-">-</a><a href="#NEXT">NEXT</a> loop with 50000 repeats and a four-byte counter variable requires
about 1.315 seconds in the compiler. This is irrespective of whether the
counter variable is a local or a global variable.

Once compiled, the loop with the local variable takes about 0.595 seconds,
while the loop with the global variable needs only about 0.385 seconds.

This speed ratio between local and global variables is different with some
other languages. In C for instance, as a general rule, routines with local
variables are faster than the same routines with global variables.

In some cases the compiler will optimize simple math.

In these examples the math/function becomes a single instruction:
